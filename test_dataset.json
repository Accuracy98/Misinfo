Trey Gowdy supported examination of voting rules and procedures. Gowdy, a Fox News contributor, also said those “ alleging widespread fraud ” needed to provide proof for those charges. But a viral post on Facebook, which uses a photo of Gowdy, falsely attributes claims about voter fraud in 2020 to the former South Carolina congressman, who served from 2011 until Jan. 3, 2019 . The post, which is from February and has racked up 38,000 shares, reads: “‘We are not talking about fraudulent voting acts. What we are talking about is TREASON! When you coordinate six to ten states, using cyber warfare to change the outcome, these are TREASONOUS acts.’ – Trey Gowdy” We found versions of the post dating back to December . Another was posted to Instagram on May 20 and amassed nearly 5,000 likes. But the posts and the quote did not come from Gowdy.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Post Offers Misleading Advice on Mandatory Vaccines and Unemployment Benefits\". [/INST] Major companies, health care operations and smaller businesses around the country are starting to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines or be tested regularly to maintain a healthy workplace and stop the spread of the disease, which has claimed the lives of more than 615,000 Americans . More than 166 million people, about half the nation’s population, had been fully vaccinated in the U.S. by Aug. 11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Large firms adopting mandatory vaccine policies include Google, United Airlines and Tyson Foods. Giant retailers such as Walmart and Walgreens are requiring corporate employees to get their shots to return to the office, but have not extended the mandate to retail employees. Against this backdrop, a Facebook post is offering misleading advice for those who don’t want the vaccine. “If your employer is mandating any pokes, DO NOT QUIT,” the post says. “Make them fire you. That way, you get unemployment benefits and can pursue legal action.” But, for most employees, that’s bad advice. Unemployment benefit laws vary from state to state. But in most states, employees fired for misconduct — particularly for violating company policy aimed at protecting workplace safety — are not entitled to collect unemployment, said Rebecca L. Baker, chair of the labor and employment practice group at the law firm Bracewell LLP. “If you wait and let your employer terminate you for failing to get a vaccine in compliance of the policy, you are unlikely to be approved for unemployment benefits,” Baker, who is based at her firm’s Houston office, told us in a phone interview. Yoora Pak, a partner in the employment and labor practice of the law firm Wilson Elser, in McLean, Virginia, told us in an email that a state “unemployment agency may also see an employee’s refusal to get vaccinated as a voluntary resignation (i.e., employer is willing to employ as long as you get vaccinated, but because you choose not to, you have voluntarily separated yourself), which may disqualify you from benefits.” According to an article published by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , “In general, unemployment benefits are available to those who were let go through no fault of their own.” So far, at least seven states have adopted legislation that would prevent certain employers from imposing COVID-19 vaccination requirements, according to the non-partisan National Academy for State Health Policy. Baker said Montana is the only state to impose a ban on private firms, while most of the others are directed at government entities and companies that do business with the state. “That is not to say other states (a) haven’t tried and (b) won’t continue to try to apply it to private employers,” she said. Jude Nwaokobia, an employment law attorney with Kalijarvi, Chuzi, Newman & Fitch in Washington, D.C., noted on the firm’s website that the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment Commission ruled in May that a private firm can “mandate all its employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated for COVID-19.” But, Nwaokobia wrote, “an employer is required to reasonably accommodate an employee who, because of a disability, pregnancy or a sincerely held religious belief, did not or cannot get vaccinated for COVID-19.” Those accommodations could include allowing the unvaccinated employee to wear a face mask when entering the workplace, working at a social distance from others, working a modified schedule, being given the opportunity to telework or reassigning the employee to a different workplace or position, Nwaokobia also wrote. Baker said she is seeing more and more businesses requiring employees who are not vaccinated to be tested for COVID-19 on an average of twice a week. Pak said businesses need to be careful in enforcing vaccine mandates. “Given that COVID is still relatively new in terms of the law, and since UI [Unemployment Insurance] benefit regulations vary state by state, an employer would need to individually assess why an employee has refused to vaccinate, if an employee has requested an exemption from a mandatory policy as a reasonable accommodation, and be consistent in how such accommodation requests are handled to avoid discrimination claims,” Pak said. The Blank Rome law firm conducted a survey of 150 clients in July and found 16% of businesses are requiring employees to be vaccinated, while 14% are mandating it only for new hires. A Morning Consult poll released July 28 found that 56% of adults said employers should probably or definitely require COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees and customers; 32% were opposed.

[/INST] In the wake of the U.S. military withdrawal, conservative commentators and politicians shared a video on social media that showed a person dangling from a helicopter in Afghanistan and — although the circumstances shown in the video were unclear — they claimed that it showed a “hanging” conducted by the Taliban. For example, Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas retweeted a copy of the video posted by someone who describes himself as a comedian and had claimed that it showed the “Taliban hanging someone from a helicopter in Kandahar.” Liz Wheeler , a conservative commentator and former host on One America News Network, retweeted another copy of the video and added this message: “If this is what it looks like… the Taliban hanging somebody from an American Blackhawk… I could vomit. Joe Biden is responsible.” Another commentator, Carmine Sabia , tweeted the video with this claim: “This is the Taliban, that the Biden administration called ‘pragmatic’ and ‘businesslike’ Pragmatically and businesslike hanging an American interpreter from an American Blackhawk helicopter and if the GOP has any balls this would be every campaign ad in 2022.” Donald Trump Jr. changed the banner at the top of his Twitter page to an image of President Joe Biden’s campaign logo with a silhouette of a helicopter with a dangling body. Sen. Ted Cruz, also of Texas, retweeted the same video as Crenshaw, although Cruz later acknowledged that the tweet “may be inaccurate” and deleted his original message. But the unsupported claim was shared across social media platforms and received tens of thousands of interactions on Facebook. As we said, the situation shown in the video is unclear, but a closer look from another vantage point appears to show a person in a harness who is waving at those below rather than someone being hanged. The Indian fact-checking website Alt News posted a thorough examination of the incident, including another video of the helicopter posted by an Afghan news service, which told Alt News, “We have a team there, they have confirmed that the person was controlled and hanging from the helicopter to fix the flag at the governor’s building in Kandahar.” Another journalist from Afghanistan, Bilal Sarwary , also said that the person suspended from the helicopter was trying to change a flag. He tweeted : “Afghan pilot flying this is someone I have known over the years. He was trained in the US and [United Arab Emirates], he confirmed to me that he flew the Blackhawk helicopter. Taliban fighter seen here was trying to install Taliban flag from air but it didn’t work in the end.” It’s also worth noting that the widely shared video appears to have been originally posted on Twitter by an account that described itself as the “official account of Islamic Emirate Afghanistan,” which is the Taliban . The message that accompanied the video said nothing about a hanging or execution. Rather, it said , “Our Air Force! At this time, the Islamic Emirate’s air force helicopters are flying over Kandahar city and patrolling the city.” That account has since been suspended . We asked Twitter why, and we have not received a response. We also asked the Department of Defense for comment on the video or credible reports of hangings by the Taliban, but did not hear back. We will update this story if we do. So, we can’t say for sure what is happening in the video, but an Afghan news service and another journalist both reported that it showed an attempt to fix or install a flag. We could find no credible reports of a hanging and, as we said, from some vantage points it appears the person suspended from the helicopter is in a harness, waving.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"U.S. COVID-19 Vaccines Follow Conventional Health Standards and Protocols\". [/INST] A social media post spouting a list of false claims about the COVID-19 vaccines has saturated right-wing pockets of the internet over the last seven months, sowing doubts about vaccines that have proven to be safe and effective. The list repeats some broad claims about the vaccines that we’ve addressed before and includes some new ones, which we’ll explain below. It has shown up in all kinds of forums online — pasted in the comment section of a news website, published as a letter to the editor , posted on Reddit , featured on the website of a British neo-Nazi and self-described “white rights veteran,” used as the primary text for an Australian website called antivaxxs.com. And, of course, it’s been ubiquitous on social media, from far-right sites like Gab to mainstream sites like Facebook . It’s also been posted in Filipino , Portuguese , Spanish and French . We don’t know where the list originated, but the earliest versions we could find started circulating in the summer of 2021. We reached out to some of the first posters on Facebook, but we didn’t hear back. None of them credit the original source and, over time, the posts started to be attributed to an unnamed nurse . Recently, posts attributing it to a doctor affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital — with the name of the hospital spelled wrong — have been going around. One is in English, and the other is in Portuguese — but they each cite a different person as the author. The English version claims it’s from a virologist named James Kelly, but there’s nobody with that name and description licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, where Johns Hopkins is located. The text from that version of the post is below, with the claims we’ll address highlighted in bold: We’ll address each claim here: “I have never seen a vaccine that forced me to wear a mask and maintain my social distance.” It’s not the vaccine that compels people to wear masks, but the disease that does. Public health officials began recommending that people wear masks in an effort to slow the spread of the respiratory virus in the spring of 2020, when vaccines were not yet publicly available. They’ve adjusted their recommendations about safety measures like wearing a mask or staying six feet away from others as the pandemic has evolved. For example, in May 2021, after vaccines had become widely available in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its recommendation to say, “Fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.” Then, in July, after the delta variant arose and vaccination rates lagged in some areas, the CDC responded by recommending that everyone, including those who were fully vaccinated, wear face masks indoors in areas of substantial or high transmission rates. Similarly, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, emphasized his organization’s global guidance in the fall, saying , “even if you are vaccinated, continue to take precautions to prevent becoming infected yourself, and to infecting someone else who could die. That means wearing a mask, maintaining distance, avoiding crowds and meeting others outside if you can, or in a well-ventilated space inside.” As the WHO explained at the time, it recommended wearing a mask and keeping a safe distance from others after vaccination because not everyone could be vaccinated and no vaccine is 100% effective. “I had never heard of vaccine that spreads the virus even after vaccination.” As we just said, no vaccine is 100% effective, which means that some people who are fully vaccinated can be infected with the pathogen they’ve been vaccinated against and spread it to others. It’s called a breakthrough infection . “While the term might be unfamiliar to most people, breakthrough infections have been seen many times before with other vaccines that protect against other diseases,” Dr. Devang Sanghavi , a critical care specialist at the Mayo Clinic, explained in a piece for the American Medical Association. “It’s kind of more mainstream now because of COVID, the pandemic and how it’s created global attention … but traditional vaccines in the past also have had their breakthrough infections, so this isn’t new,” he said. Flu vaccines, for example, are most associated with breakthrough infections, according to an article in Scientific American . Tara Smith , an epidemiology professor in the College of Public Health at Kent State University, explained that if breakthrough cases of the flu were tracked as closely as breakthrough cases of COVID-19, the number would be much higher. Breakthrough cases of COVID-19, she said, are “just another Wednesday,” compared with those that occur with other vaccines. As we’ve explained before , the COVID-19 vaccines that have been authorized or approved in the U.S. have been highly effective at preventing symptomatic disease – until omicron became the dominant variant. But early studies on omicron show that booster doses substantially increase protection against the new variant. For example, a recent CDC study found a third dose of mRNA vaccines increased effectiveness against hospitalization when omicron was predominant from 57% at six months or more after a second mRNA dose to 90% at least 14 days after the third dose. A recent review of breakthrough cases from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that the vaccines kept patients alive and out of the hospital in nearly 97% of breakthrough cases. It also found that those who were unvaccinated were 31 times more likely to become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated and had received a booster shot. That review covered the year since vaccines became available — from December 2020 to the beginning of December 2021. So it didn’t include data from when omicron had become the dominant variant in late December. According to the CDC , the vaccines are still effective in preventing severe disease, but recent data suggests their effectiveness wanes over time, especially for those who are 65 or older. The agency stressed the importance of vaccination and booster shots to fight the omicron variant. “I had never heard of rewards, discounts, incentives to get vaccinated.” Incentive programs — including those that have offered baby products, gift certificates for groceries, or cash payments — have been used for decades and research has shown that they are effective in increasing immunization. “Vaccine incentives are rooted in the psychology of how people make economic and health decisions,” the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development explained in an information sheet about the programs. “Studies on vaccine incentive programs show that they result in a higher adherence to recommended immunizations,” HUD said, citing six examples. In 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Community Preventive Services Task Force recommended the use of such programs, citing an economic review of seven studies that evaluated various offers. “The evidence indicates even small incentives can be effective in increasing vaccination rates and the reach can be substantial when such incentives are provided as part of benefits within health plans,” the task force recommendation said. In June, the Blavatnik Institute’s Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School published an evaluation of the potential for incentives to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates, and it included the same review. “There is strong evidence to suggest that incentive reward programs for vaccination may be effective in increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake,” the evaluation found. “However,” the paper warned, “states are tasked with designing and implementing incentive program structures that effectively target their respective vaccine hesitant populations — considering variations in incentive types and amounts (monetary vs. non-monetary), targeted populations (adolescent vs. elder population; patient vs. provider), and length of reward programs.” Indeed, states across the country have offered incentives to encourage COVID-19 vaccination. They included park passes in several states, a chance to dine with the governor of New Jersey, and amusement park passes in Illinois , among other things. “I have never seen a vaccine used to threaten livelihoods, work or school.” This claim appears to be a reference to COVID-19 vaccine requirements, which have been politically divisive. But vaccine requirements — for both school and work — existed long before COVID-19. In fact, the first requirement for inoculation in the U.S. came more than 200 years ago and predates modern vaccination. In 1777, George Washington ordered all soldiers fighting in the Revolutionary War to be inoculated against smallpox, which was ravaging the Continental Army. Inoculation was done by a process called variolation , which meant either inhaling or inserting under the skin puss taken from smallpox sores on patients who were sick with the disease. In 1809, after vaccines were developed, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate vaccination, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. In 1827, Boston became the first city to mandate vaccination for public school students. Other states followed . Those early mandates addressed smallpox, which was a recurring problem in early America and killed an average of three in 10 people who got it, according to the CDC . By the end of the 20th century, though, a global vaccination campaign had eradicated the disease . Now all 50 states require students to have various vaccinations in order to go to school, although each one offers medical exemptions and 44 (plus Washington, D.C.) grant religious exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . States generally follow federal guidance on the recommended vaccination schedule , according to a report from the Policy, Practice and Prevention Research Center in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois Chicago. Some states also require workers in medical or long-term care facilities to have various vaccinations. For example, 15 states require hospital health care workers to have a measles, mumps or rubella vaccine, according to data from the CDC. There are also some local ordinances requiring hepatitis A vaccination for restaurant workers. St. Louis , Missouri; Franklin County , Missouri; Ashland , Kentucky; and Boyd County , Kentucky all require that shot. So, contrary to what’s claimed in the post, vaccination requirements for work and school are nothing new. “I have never seen a vaccine that would allow a 12-year-old to override parental consent.” The CDC recommends that everyone ages 5 and older to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently the only one authorized in the U.S. for children. In almost all states, parental consent is required for minors to get that shot, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis that was last updated in October. A few states allow those under 18 to get vaccinated without permission from their parents, but only five of them (and the District of Columbia) allow those as young as 12 to do so. Here’s the breakdown: Those laws apply to most vaccines, including those for COVID-19. Two cities — Philadelphia and San Francisco — have made allowances specifically for COVID-19 vaccines. In Philadelphia, those who are 11 and older can get a COVID-19 vaccine without a parent’s consent, and in San Francisco, those who are 12 and older can do so. So, in most cases, the rules for parental consent aren’t different for COVID-19 vaccines than for other vaccines and, in most states, minors need parental consent. “It’s a powerful vaccine! She does all these things except IMMUNIZATION.” Two types of vaccines are available in the U.S. There are mRNA vaccines , like those from Pfizer and Moderna, and there’s a viral vector vaccine from Johnson & Johnson. While there are differences in the specifics of how each of those types of vaccines work, both types generally work by telling the immune system how to recognize key features of the virus that causes COVID-19 and prompts the immune system to make antibodies that would fight it off. We know that they are effective in creating immunity because clinical trials showed more than 90% efficacy for the mRNA vaccines and 66% efficacy for the viral vector vaccine. Further studies have shown that they are effective in real-world settings and that they remain highly effective in preventing serious disease. Also, data from the CDC shows that the number of deaths from COVID-19 began decreasing markedly as vaccines became more widely available, a trend that continued until the delta variant arose and vaccination rates slowed.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Video Makes False Claim About Global Oil Supply\". [/INST] Oil is a finite resource that takes millions of years to form, according to scientists , and it can’t be replenished at anywhere near the rate at which it is being used. “There is a finite amount of oil in the world,” Andrew Kleit, professor of energy and environmental economics at Pennsylvania State University, told us in a phone interview. “Oil is created through a geologic process that takes millions of years,” he said. “Any new oil that’s created is created very slowly, whereas we consume it fairly rapidly” in comparison, he added. “The scarcity value of oil is reflected in the market price,” Kleit said. Oil companies, including BP and Shell , are studying how to produce alternative fuels. They are addressing concerns that burning fossil fuels harm the environment, and they know that once the oil that exists runs out, there will be no way to replace it. Yet, a TikTok video shared April 30 and May 1 on Instagram falsely claims there’s an endless supply of oil available on the Earth. “There is an unlimited amount of oil,” the video says. It also misleadingly claims water is unlimited, too. The claims on the video, which has received more than 10,000 likes, are similar to false claims made on a 2021 Facebook video that said John D. Rockefeller coined the term “fossil fuel” to “induce the idea of scarcity” and drive up oil prices. The TikTok video also references Rockefeller. “When the Rockefellers bought out the educational system, they taught us a scarcity mindset to put us into a fear state,” says the video, posted by a TikTok  account called Cultivate Elevate , which sells health-related products on its website. The video also says workers on oil rigs have described being sent back to wells that had “supposedly” gone dry and then finding oil in them. Crude oil and petroleum are known as fossil fuels because they were formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals into a hydrocarbon mixture. “Oil, like natural gas and coal, is a fuel that was literally made from fossils, the dead remains of once-living things that have been slowly, through a combination of pressure and temperature, been converted into solid [coal], liquid [oil], and gas,” Michael Mann, director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email on May 9. Mann noted that renowned scientist Carl Sagan referred to oil’s origin in pointing out the “absurdity” of our dependence on fossil fuels: “Our civilization runs by burning the remains of humble creatures who inhabited the Earth hundreds of millions of years before the first humans came on the scene,” Sagan said. “Like some ghastly cannibal cult, we subsist on the dead bodies of our ancestors and distant relatives.” The video’s claim that oil is unlimited is “silly,” Mann said. “Crude oil is the result of geological processes beneath Earth’s surface that play out over hundreds of millions of years,” he said. “We’re extracting it over a time frame of decades, more than a million times as fast as nature could in principle replace it.” Addressing the video’s claim that oil workers were called back to rigs previously deemed dry, Mann said: “Which is more likely, that oil is magically being generated a million times faster than known geological processes can generate it? Or that some workers on oil rigs missed a spot the first time they searched it?” Climate change, Mann said, provides a “compelling argument” against finding new ways of extracting fossil fuel, further decreasing the supply of oil. As we’ve written before , there is a growing body of scientific evidence that climate change is occurring, largely caused by human activity, including the burning of oil, gas and coal. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessed how nations around the world are working to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels in its April 2022 report . The video’s claim that water is unlimited is likewise wrong, Mann said. While there is a large amount of water on the planet, most of it is salt water in the oceans — and desalination is an expensive, energy-intensive process that isn’t practical, he said. Fresh water is similarly “tied up” in glaciers, leaving only about 1% of total water accessible for human use, Mann said. Water is already in limited supply. In a 2022 report , the World Meteorological Organization, an agency of the United Nations, estimated that “3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water at least a month per year” — a figure that is expected to rise to “more than 5 billion by 2050.” “Human beings require fresh water,” said Penn State’s Kleit. “And in many parts of the world, including the Western United States, fresh water is very scarce.”"

[/INST] Actor Denzel Washington has repeatedly been the target of bogus stories about his political views. As we reported in 2018 , a fabricated article incorrectly attributed a string of quotes critical of former President Barack Obama to the actor — even though Washington supported Obama and said Obama did a “great job” as president. False claims about Washington praising former President Donald Trump also were widely shared online in 2016. More recently, a social media post falsely claims that Washington left the Democratic Party to help Trump and his allies. One version of the post , uploaded to Instagram on June 23, has amassed more than 1,000 likes. The post appears to be a screenshot of a satirical article titled, “Denzel Washington Leaves Democrat Party: ‘I’ve Had it With the Lies.'” The post continues: “Denzel Washington, who has never stepped outside the realm of acting to engage in politics, has taken a stand. It won’t be very popular with Democrats. In an Interview with America’s Last Line of Defense, Denzel said that he couldn’t handle the constant lies and that he’s turning his attention to helping team Trump:” The made-up article first appeared in 2019 on bustatroll.org , a website that describes its content as satire meant to provoke conservatives. It is one of several such websites operated by America’s Last Line of Defense , which is cited in the post as the source of Washington’s quote. The “About Us” page for bustatroll.org provides several disclaimers regarding the outlet’s content, including, “Everything on this website is fiction. It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real.” The site calls itself a “subsidiary of the ‘America’s Last Line of Defense’ network of parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” We previously wrote about America’s Last Line of Defense in our list of websites that post deceptive content. In response to the post, Alan Nierob , a representative for Washington, told us via email: “Without confirming his political affiliation, this post is a complete fabrication.” Although Nierob did not comment on the actor’s political affiliation, a search of Washington’s political donation history shows multiple past contributions to Democrats. The actor donated $28,500 to help elect Obama and gave $27,000 in support of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Targets Gates With Old Clip, Misleading Edit\". [/INST] A Facebook video viewed more than 100,000 times is using a deceptively edited clip of Bill Gates to accuse the Microsoft co-founder of advocating for a nefarious plan to depopulate the world through vaccines. The video — captioned, “ Take a look at this #DepopulationAgenda” — employs a computer-generated voiceover that suggests Gates and other high-profile philanthropists want to remove some portion of the global population. The same video was uploaded to YouTube in April 2020, as misinformation relating to Gates swirled on social media.  The Facebook version includes ominous music and is presented as a meme, adding an apocalyptic image of a syringe in front of a pile of skulls to further imply a deadly plan is afoot. The narration tells viewers it will use quotes directly from “Bill Gates himself so that later no one will accuse me of allegedly distorting his words.” But then it does just that. The video misleadingly edits Gates’ 2010 TED Talk — “ Innovating to zero! ” — which focused on the need to zero out carbon dioxide emissions through new approaches to energy production in order to fight climate change . Ignoring Gates’ theme of energy innovation, the video misleadingly portrays the speech as evidence of a purported “depopulation” agenda that involves COVID-19 and the global vaccination efforts of Gates, the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies. Before showing parts of Gates’ 2010 talk, the video presents part of a 2009 story in the Guardian that reported that Gates and other billionaire philanthropists had met and discussed overpopulation as a serious issue facing the world. But that was only one topic discussed. The video ignores that the group reportedly discussed a range of other issues, too — including education, government reform and the economic crisis at that time. It’s also worth noting — since the Facebook video doesn’t — that the same Guardian story also reported that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation vaccination project — Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance — was estimated at the time “to have prevented 3.4 million deaths in just eight years.” After its selective use of the Guardian article, the video then goes on to show a clip from Gates’ 2010 TED Talk as he was discussing the amount of carbon dioxide produced each year around the world. That portion of Gates’ talk has spawned a false narrative that has persisted over the years that argues Gates was calling for the killing of millions of people by using vaccines — a narrative that the Facebook video again revisits. It’s clear, however, that Gates was referring once again to his belief that improving health and reducing child deaths, including through vaccines , can have the effect of limiting future population growth — which he has talked about many other times. In 2012, he again spoke about the need in underdeveloped countries to provide family planning services and better health care to decrease child mortality in order to deal with overpopulation. Similarly, in 2018, Melinda Gates, his wife and co-founder of the couple’s foundation, said : “When more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood.” Bill Gates went on in his full, unedited TED Talk to spend most of his time focusing on the need to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions through innovation in energy production. For example, he spoke about one venture he backs that aims to create more efficient nuclear energy by using the waste created by current nuclear reactors. But the video on Facebook cuts all of that — nearly 13 minutes in total — and moves directly from Gates briefly referencing the prospect of limiting population growth rate to his saying it’s his “wish” for such a technology. It provides no context for viewers to understand what hoped-for technology he was referencing. The edited video picks up his talk here: “So what have we heard from Bill?” the video voiceover says. “Global warming — which is supposedly caused by anthropogenic carbon emission — and to reset it, you need to slightly reduce the world’s population.” As we said, Gates briefly suggested that health care and vaccines could reduce the rate at which the population grows — but he didn’t propose killing off humans, as the video implies. His focus in the Ted Talk was on reducing carbon dioxide emissions by transforming the energy sector — something this misleading video leaves on the cutting-room floor. The full TED Talk can be seen here:  The Facebook video continues by showing a 2011 clip of Gates speaking with CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his pledge to spend $10 billion over a decade on vaccination efforts. He said in the interview that by reducing the number of children who die every year through vaccines, “the benefits there are in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth, it really allows society a chance to take care of itself.” The video presents a loop of Gates saying the words, “reducing the population growth,” and then asks: “Amazing, isn’t it?” Except, as we said, Gates has been transparent about his belief that improved health and vaccines could reduce population growth . The video concludes by sowing doubt about the global response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It presents a lengthy video clip of Gates in 2015 discussing the need for pandemic preparedness — followed by details of Gates’ significant contributions to WHO and his foundation’s participation in a 2019 preparedness exercise involving a coronavirus — to baselessly insinuate that Gates, WHO and the pharmaceutical industry are behind a global effort to kill people. As we’ve explained before, such preparedness exercises have been held for many years. And some experts had warned of the potential for coronaviruses (which are a family of viruses) to trigger a pandemic at least 20 years before the 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But the video ignores all of that context, instead feeding viewers a narrative that is heavy on innuendo and lacking in evidence. See more of our SciCheck work to learn about COVID-19 and vaccines.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Have Not Been Shown to Cause ‘Turbo Cancer’\". [/INST] COVID-19 has killed more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. People with cancer who get COVID-19 have an elevated risk of severe disease and death , especially those who have certain blood cancers . Vaccines help mitigate these risks . The COVID-19 vaccines can cause largely minor and short-lived side effects , such as fatigue and soreness at the injection site, which have been generally consistent in people with and without cancer. There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer for people who already have it. However, unsupported claims that the COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer have repeatedly surfaced on social media . “SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer,” recent posts have said . They claimed that a single mouse in this study “died suddenly,” a phrase associated with a family of groundless claims that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing large numbers of people. Sander Eens , a cardiovascular disease researcher at the University of Antwerp who co-authored the study in question, criticized how the social media posts characterized his work. “Specifically, our case report has been misinterpreted as evidence that Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 mRNA vaccine could cause a scientifically unrecognized phenomenon called ‘turbo-cancer,’” he told us in an email. “Turbo cancer” is a term used by people who claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and can cause particularly fast-growing cancer, but there isn’t evidence that this phenomenon is real. The recent study, published May 1 in Frontiers in Oncology, describes one mouse that died from lymphoma out of 14 mice that were given a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine delivered into their veins, which is not how the COVID-19 vaccines are given to people. The study does not show the mouse’s blood cancer was related to the vaccine. “Our case report in no way attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between the identified lymphoma and the mRNA vaccine,” Eens said. He added that he and his colleagues have now dosed 70 mice with the vaccine and have seen no further cases of any type of cancer. Dr. Jason D. Goldman , an infectious disease physician, clinical researcher and epidemiologist at Swedish Medical Center and the University of Washington, emphasized the difficulty of determining whether one event causes another. “You really can’t tell from a one-off if something has a causal relationship, meaning, does the vaccine cause the cancer? … Cancer happens, and when you vaccinate billions of people, of course many events are going to happen after the vaccines because that’s what happens and it would have happened anyway,” he said. “When we start seeing more patterns is when we think about causality.” So far, researchers have not seen a larger pattern. “Lastly, we would like to stress that COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy in the fight against the pandemic, and manifestations of serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare,” Eens told us. “To date, there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between mRNA vaccines and cancer development.” COVID-19 vaccines are injected into the muscle . Eens and his colleagues gave mice either a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or a placebo delivered directly into their bloodstream. The study was not meant to evaluate cancer in mice. Rather, the researchers were attempting to induce myocarditis, they explained in their paper , with the intent to use the mice to study this problem. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a rare serious side effect of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The mice generally did not experience adverse events, with the exception of the one mouse that died of B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma two days after its second vaccine dose. Lymphomas are cancers of immune cells originating in the lymphatic system. There are many different types of lymphoma and they come with a variety of possible treatments and prognoses in humans. Sanjay Mishra , coordinator of the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry and a researcher at Brown University, told us in an email that the particular type of mice used in the study “are predisposed to developing sarcomas and lymphomas, which is why they are used so frequently in neoplastic [cancer-related] studies.” He also said the “unusually high concentration” of vaccine delivered to the mice and the intravenous delivery were limitations of the work. Eens called his paper a “case report” and explained that these studies “are certainly not used to demonstrate causality (i.e., in this case between COVID-19 vaccination and the lymphoma).” Writing on his blog Respectful Insolence, surgical oncologist and researcher Dr. David Gorski said that it was highly unusual to even write a case report about a mouse — case reports are usually done to describe clinical cases in humans. Gorski also estimated that relative to their body weight, the mice got a vaccine dose that was hundreds of times greater than the dose adult humans get. And he said that the mouse likely already had cancer before ever being vaccinated, pointing out that it had already lost a large amount of weight before getting the first dose — a sign of preexisting disease. The COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials , which helped establish their more common side effects and did not show a link between the vaccines and cancer. Safety monitoring systems look out for further side effects once vaccines are broadly available. And although the initial COVID-19 vaccine trials did not include many people with cancer, researchers have subsequently studied safety in this group of people. “Whether original trials studied enough cases with lymphoma or not, there is no evidence since their roll-out that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” Mishra said. Pfizer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration told Lead Stories in response to questions about Eens’s study that their monitoring had not uncovered a causal link or safety signal related to cancer and COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists have raised theoretical concerns about a relationship between vaccination and lymphoma before, based on an association of some lymphomas with inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Vaccines “may overstimulate the immune system as well as trigger autoimmune responses,” Mishra said. Dr. Jeremy Warner , a physician focused on blood cancer and cancer informatics at Brown University, told us that “lymphomas are a very unusual family of cancers and I don’t want to pretend that we know everything about their etiology.” He said that inflammation-related lymphomas are often indolent , meaning they are slow-growing. Studies have mainly either found no association between vaccination and risk of lymphoma or have found a decreased risk. A 2022 study of 2,461 people with lymphoma and 2,253 people without lymphoma compared their history of vaccination for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, yellow fever and flu. The study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, did not find an increased risk of lymphoma in people who had been vaccinated and found that vaccination was in some cases associated with a lower risk of lymphoma. “COVID-19 vaccines should be no different than other vaccines, despite being of a different class,” Mishra said. Eens and his colleagues cited past case reports of lymphoma diagnosis, progression, regression or recurrence in humans after vaccination. These case reports describe a variety of types of lymphoma. As we have discussed, case reports can help guide hypotheses, but they are not meant to be definitive or show causal relationships. “Any observations in humans are most likely confusing correlation for causation,” Warner said. He added that “most people are getting vaccinated now, which means most new lymphoma diagnoses will occur in temporal relation to vaccination, whether or not they have anything to do with vaccination.” Some of the case reports describe lymphomas that developed on one side near the site of vaccination, but this is also not necessarily evidence that the vaccines caused the lymphomas. A study published earlier this year in Cancer Medicine illustrates this point. A group of German researchers decided to look into lymphoma and COVID-19 vaccination at two medical centers after they diagnosed lymphoma in the armpits of two patients. These lymphomas were found on the same sides where the patients had been vaccinated, in lymph nodes that could have received drainage from the deltoid region where the COVID-19 vaccines are generally given. But after analyzing 313 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the researchers found that lymphomas manifested on one side of the body in deltoid drainage lymph nodes at similar rates both before and after the COVID-19 vaccines became available. For patients diagnosed with lymphoma after vaccination, there was no association between the sides where the lymphomas appeared and where they got the shot. The CDC and various cancer-related organizations recommend that cancer patients get vaccinated against COVID-19. Some people with cancer, particularly those with certain blood cancers or receiving certain treatments, may have a weaker immune response to the vaccines. Even so, most patients have at least some benefit from vaccination. “Patients with hematologic malignancies are at greater risk of illness and mortality from COVID-19, so despite the limited immunological response of the vaccines, they are highly advised to get the vaccines and boosters,” Mishra said. “When we give vaccines to patients with lymphoma, we don’t see any turbocharging of the cancer clinically, and we do see protection sometimes from getting COVID at all, but more commonly from getting a serious form of COVID that could result in getting on a ventilator or death,” said Goldman, who specializes in treating immunocompromised patients in his work as an infectious disease doctor at Swedish Medical Center. The CDC recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get extra vaccine doses. This group includes people who have blood cancers associated with reduced vaccine response, as well as people with cancer who are currently in treatment."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Chiropractor Again Peddles False, Misleading COVID-19 Claims\". [/INST] A St. Louis chiropractor who in April was accused by federal officials of deceptively marketing unproven COVID-19 treatments is airing baseless and false claims about the novel coronavirus that causes the disease and public health measures designed to prevent its spread.  Eric Nepute — who was the first person charged with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, and who has spread misinformation that we’ve debunked before — took to an Aug. 17 livestream on Facebook to baselessly suggest that recent pandemic-related events, as well as the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, are somehow actually efforts “to keep you distracted” from the issue of voter fraud. In the video, viewed more than 60,000 times, Nepute continues by rattling off a string of false and misleading claims related to COVID-19 — including about the delta variant, and certain mask and vaccine requirements. We fact-checked several of his claims. Referring to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that everyone in schools — regardless of vaccination status — use face masks, Nepute claims that it’s “all because of the quote unquote delta variant.” He claims that the variant “is not showing more deaths, it is not showing more of a problem — we are not seeing pediatric hospitals filled. They’re trying to scare you.” First of all, as we’ve explained , the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is about twice as transmissible as the original versions of the virus. In July, it became the dominant strain in the U.S. and is now estimated to account for virtually all infections. Though, it’s unclear whether the variant, while more transmissible, actually causes more severe disease. The rise of delta has helped spur a significant spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are up significantly from early July, according to CDC data. It also prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that even vaccinated individuals wear masks indoors in areas with substantial or high transmission of the coronavirus. Children do continue to comprise a very small portion of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association estimated , based on data collected from 23 states and New York City, that as of Aug. 19 “children ranged from 1.6%-3.6% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.2%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.” That said, the number of children being admitted to hospitals for the disease also has continued to increase since early July, CDC data show. The U.S. averaged 303 new daily hospital admissions for children with confirmed COVID-19 during the week of Aug. 16 to Aug. 22 — a new high. Total pediatric hospital admissions for COVID-19 reached a high of nearly 2,000 earlier this month. Some children’s hospitals have reported nearing capacity , with some officials citing COVID-19 cases as well as increased cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Dr. Roberta DeBiasi , division chief of infectious diseases at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., told NPR that delta’s increased transmissibility was likely to blame for the larger volume of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in children. “If you have a larger number of cases overall and you apply that percentage, you’re going to see children hospitalized,” she said. “And that’s really the most important take home for families is that there’s nothing particularly more dangerous about the delta variant for children, but it has always remained a danger.” The AAP reported based on available state data that, as of Aug. 19, more than 180,000 COVID-19 cases in children “were added the past week, reaching levels of the previous winter surge of 2020-21.” “After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over a four-fold increase the past month, rising from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22nd to 180,000 the past week,” the organization said. In an Aug. 5 letter to the Food and Drug Administration regarding the need to vaccinate children against COVID-19, AAP President Lee Savio Beers wrote that the rise in cases showed that “the Delta variant has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults.” Later in his video, Nepute tells his viewers: “There was a news reporter in Texas that was misrepresenting the numbers in Texas hospitals for pediatric sicknesses and deaths. They’re trying to completely distract you.” It’s true that an Aug. 12 news report in the Texas Tribune erroneously reported the number of children recently hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas. The original story mistakenly referred to the total number hospitalized since the pandemic began. But what Nepute doesn’t mention is that the newspaper corrected itself the same day, affixing a prominent correction at the top of its story online and notifying readers of the error.  Nepute also uses the video to argue against local mask mandates and vaccine requirements by distorting the facts about what federal officials are requiring of their own ranks. “When the truth is, the White House is not even mandating masks,” Nepute claims. “When the truth is that the CDC and the World Health Organization are not even mandating the vaccines. They’re not mandating these injections. And so why are they trying to mandate them on you when they’re not doing it for themselves?”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Views of Eclipse With Composite Images\". [/INST] A total solar eclipse — in which the moon blocked Earth’s view of the sun — occurred April 8 in a narrow path across Mexico, the United States and Canada. Crowds gathered in cities along the path, including Dallas, Cleveland and Montreal, to witness totality, the brief period in which the sun’s light is completely obscured by the moon. In addition to the sky darkening, those in the path of totality were able to see a part of the sun’s atmosphere , called the corona, which is otherwise impossible to see because of the sun’s bright light. Gary Bernstein , a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Pennsylvania, explained the appearance of the corona in an email to us. “The sun is always in the process of ejecting a tenuous stream of gas into space. This gas emits a very faint light compared to the sun’s main body, so while it’s always present in the sky, we can’t see it on a normal day because it’s lost in the glare of the disk of the sun,” he said. “During a total eclipse, the moon blocks the disk, and the sky becomes dark enough to see the corona.  This only occurs during the totality phase,” Bernstein said. Another phenomenon known as Baily’s Beads — beads of light that appear around the edge of the moon during an eclipse — occurs just as totality begins and ends. “They occur because the moon has mountains and valleys, and the last rays of the sun can pass through the valleys while the mountains block light. This breaks up the very thin final arc of light into pieces,” Bernstein explained. NASA uploaded a photo album of pictures taken during the recent eclipse, many of which show Baily’s Beads and the sun’s corona . But some social media posts have shared the painting of a composite image or an altered image of these phenomena, and misleadingly claimed they were photos of the recent eclipse. One image, featuring a dramatic corona, was shared on Facebook on April 9 with the caption, “Most Detailed Image of the Solar Eclipse.” The post received 88,000 likes, but has since been removed. Several other posts also shared the image on social media, falsely claiming it was a photo taken during the eclipse and “captured by NASA.” Through a reverse image search, we found this image is actually a digital painting from 2020 by artist Cathrin Machin . As she wrote in an Instagram caption on July 20, 2020, Machin based her painting on a picture created by astrophotographer Sebastian Voltmer in Wyoming during the 2017 total solar eclipse. Voltmer uploaded his original photo to Flickr in September 2017, and he wrote that the photo was a composite of 35 images taken during the eclipse. Bernstein explained that many astrophotographers use composite images — that is, an image produced by combining two or more photos — “since we are taking pictures of things the human eye can’t see.” He added: “They’re not what your eye would see but they are ‘real’ in the sense of being an image of what’s truly in the sky.” Alexei Filippenko , a professor of astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, told us, “Cameras are good at capturing the solar corona, but only with composites made from images having many different exposures. A given exposure doesn’t have a large ‘dynamic range’ the way the human eye does. The human eye can see faint and bright things well simultaneously, but a photo cannot.” Another image, which shows both Baily’s Beads and the corona, was posted to Facebook on April 10 with a caption misleadingly claiming it was from the recent eclipse. The caption, originally in Spanish, claims that the photo is “one of the best shots of the solar eclipse.” But a spokesperson for scientists at the National Solar Observatory told us that “this image appears to be altered.” “The S-shape of the coronal streamers on the left and right of the corona is the most obvious problem,” the NSO spokesperson told us in an email. “The coronal magnetic field does not bend in such sinuous curves. They are angled and curved at times, but a 90-degree bend in the field lines is unrealistic.” Filippenko also raised concerns about the waviness of the corona in this image. “Although it could in principle look curvy… I’ve never seen it that way. Always, or almost always, the coronal streamers basically go radially outward from the Sun; they don’t curve much.” The NSO spokesperson also noted that the placement of the Baily’s Beads in this image were unlikely. “They appear all around the sun simultaneously, which is unrealistic except in a very special eclipse (when the moon was exactly the same size as the Sun, so a very brief eclipse). Also, when the Baily’s beads are still present, the corona is not yet so visible and prominent.” But during the April 8 eclipse, the moon actually appeared significantly larger than the sun, Filippenko said. Filippenko also told us the image in the April 10 Facebook post could be a composite photo of several previous eclipses, but not of the April 8 eclipse or any single eclipse."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Misuse VAERS Data to Make False Claims About COVID-19 Vaccines\". [/INST] Update, Aug. 26, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older. Millions of people in the United States have safely received COVID-19 vaccines. Over 145 million doses had been administered as of March 30, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and over 95 million people had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Most of those who have reported side effects have said they were minor , such as pain or swelling at the injection site, headaches, chills or fever — which are all consistent with the results of clinical trials . Some people have no side effects at all. And a small number of people (2 to 5 people per million vaccinated) have reported a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which “almost always” happens within a half an hour of being vaccinated, the CDC says . Yet over and over websites and social media posts improperly cite unverified raw data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to detect possible safety issues in vaccines, as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. Take this Instagram video , seen by over 36,000 users. In the video, a female narrator walks viewers through the VAERS website and shows them how to find adverse reactions reported to the database after people received the COVID-19 vaccines. “Acute myocardial infarction. That is a stroke, if you guys aren’t aware of what that means,” she says incorrectly at the 2:30 mark, as she scrolls down through the results. A myocardial infarction is a heart attack. And a couple of minutes later: “Death. And here we are y’all —  this is exactly what you guys wanted to see. Death. Patient passed away in her sleep. Look at all these deaths you guys,” the narrator says scrolling down through dozens of death reports. “Do your own research,” writes the account owner on the post, a man under the name “Truth Bombs,” who in a second similar post says he’s not a scientist or a doctor but a concerned father, patriot and digital soldier. “There are very serious side effect from getting the vaccines. Here’s your PROOF.” Except, as the VAERS website warns , any report submitted to the database “is not documentation that a vaccine caused the event.” As we’ve explained before , anyone can submit a report of an event to VAERS, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem. All reports are accepted into the database without determining whether the event was caused by a particular vaccine, and therefore, as a disclaimer warns , submissions “may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.” “One of the main limitations of VAERS data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event,” reads its website . “This limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from VAERS WONDER, specifically regarding the number of reported deaths. There have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines; that is not accurate.” So when VAERS says it has received 2,509 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine as of March 29, that does not mean that those deaths were caused by the vaccine. In fact, after reviewing medical records, autopsies and death certificates for all of those cases, physicians from both the CDC and the FDA determined that there was “no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.” The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is a national early warning system to detect possible safety issues in vaccines established by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1990. The main goal of the database is to serve as a signaling system for adverse reactions, or events, that were not detected during the clinical trials or before a vaccine entered the market. It also complies with a National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requirement for vaccine manufacturers to report all adverse events and health care providers to report specific adverse events following the administration of a vaccine."

Second, Dorworth said only that he might be right that Florida is the only state in the country with a state review procedure. Our analysis shows that Florida has a unique form of state review, but it's not the only state to have some oversight. Some are certainly less stringent. Vermont and Rhode Island offer incentives to provide oversight, while Washington offers just technical assistance to local governments. Oregon is similar in that major changes -- in its case, an expansion of the urban service boundary -- require state approval. And Hawaii has a system with a great amount of state oversight. Here's what Dorworth said: \"This is ripe for a PolitiFact, but I've asked in almost every committee we've seen this bill -- I don't believe any other state in the union has a system like we do.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Baselessly Link Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome to COVID-19 Vaccines\". [/INST] Anti-vaccine commentators and conservative politicians have been sharing a tabloid story about a medical condition that has nothing to do with COVID-19 vaccines. But they’re baselessly suggesting that there is a connection. The headline on the June 8 story from the British publication the Daily Mail said: “Healthy young people are dying suddenly and unexpectedly from a mysterious syndrome – as doctors seek answers through a new national register.” There are some things to straighten out first, which we’ll explain in more detail below: The story didn’t say anything about vaccines. But Candace Owens , a conservative commentator who has been vocal about her opposition to the COVID-19 vaccines, shared the story with her 5.4 million Facebook followers with a message that said, “Just wanted to publicly state that my children are and will remain completely unvaccinated and that I truly wish my parents had made different decisions for me.” She then wrote, “In other news— have you read about how young adults are dying suddenly and it’s a complete mystery to doctors as to why that’s happening?” Mindy Robinson, another conservative commentator who has frequently posted dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines, also posted the story on Facebook. She wrote: “Young people are dropping dead and dying in their sleep for ‘no reason’ according to ‘experts’ just like we’ve said they’ve been doing since the unrolling out of that experimental injection (that cannot be mentioned by name negatively on Facebook.)” Robinson, who is currently running for state assembly in Nevada as a Libertarian , was likely referring to Facebook’s policy aimed at discouraging misinformation about the vaccines and its partnership with fact-checkers who write about and correct false and misleading claims. Likewise, Indiana state Rep. John Jacob , who won his seat in 2020 and has been critical of COVID-19 vaccination mandates, shared a link to the story and emphasized the headline. His post asked, “ From global warming? What’s your guess?” The comments to Jacob’s post included dozens of variations on, “ Covid vaccine .” Similarly suggestive posts have been spreading in several languages on social media, including claims made in Swedish , Dutch and Polish . There is no link between SADS and COVID-19 vaccines, experts told us. SADS is caused by one of several genetic conditions that disturb the heart’s rhythm and can lead to sudden death in young people who appear to be healthy. Because the conditions are genetic, one of the best warning signs for SADS is a family history of sudden, unexplained death under the age of 40, according to the Utah-based SADS Foundation . The foundation estimates that there are 4,000 deaths attributable to the syndrome in the U.S. each year. Referring to two specific heart conditions that can cause SADS, Dr. Michael J. Ackerman , professor at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and chair of the SADS Foundation board of directors, said in a statement provided by the foundation to FactCheck.org, “There’s not a single signal of increased LQTS events or CPVT events among diagnosed and treated patients who’ve been vaccinated [against COVID-19].” Long QT Syndrome, or LQTS, is the most common condition that causes SADS, according to the British nonprofit that advocates for SADS patients, Cardiac Risk in the Young . Estimates vary, but it is present in between 1 in 2,000 to 1 in 5,000 people and is characterized by a longer than normal interval between the Q and T waves on an electrocardiogram, indicating abnormal electrical activity in the heart. CPVT, or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, is less common, occurring in an estimated 1 in 10,000 people, according to the National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. CPVT is characterized by an abnormally fast heartbeat brought on by physical activity or emotional stress. “Over two years into the pandemic, there’s been no indication in the largest programs in the world of an increase in death from these conditions,” Ackerman said. More generally, the SADS Foundation said in a statement to FactCheck.org, “There is no evidence suggesting that any of the available Covid-19 vaccines cause people to develop SADS conditions, or make people’s SADS conditions more severe.” Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not observed any relationship between COVID-19 vaccines and SADS. “To date, CDC has detected no unusual or unexpected patterns of SADS following immunization that would indicate COVID-19 vaccines are causing or contributing to this condition,” Dr. John Su, a medical officer in the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office , told us in an email. “CDC continues to recommend that everyone who is eligible should get vaccinated,” he said. The SADS Foundation also recommends that those with conditions related to SADS get vaccinated against COVID-19. As for the Daily Mail story that sparked the claims on social media, “There was some mis-reporting,” Dr. Elizabeth Paratz — who was referenced in the story but wasn’t contacted for comment — told us by email. Although both the story and the headline claimed that Australia had a “new national register” for tracking SADS, it doesn’t. That project was started in 2019 in the Australian state of Victoria. Paratz, a cardiologist who is currently researching sudden cardiac arrest, told us that the registry began “in response to recognition that what we call ‘unascertained’ or ‘unexplained’ sudden cardiac arrest in Australia and is sometimes referred to overseas as sudden arrhythmic death syndrome … is actually the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. This has been well-recognised for many years.” In a 2020 review of similar registries, Paratz and colleagues found that there were 15 sudden cardiac death registries around the world, including the one in Victoria. There has been no increase in SADS since the COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in 2021, Paratz said. Furthermore, she said, “ There is no signal that any vaccine, including the COVID-19 vaccines, are behind SADS cases.” Paratz also noted that, although the Daily Mail referred to SADS as “Sudden Adult Death Syndrome,” the “A” actually stands for arrhythmic, not adult. And she cited studies about SADS going back to 2004 , saying, “As you can see, unascertained sudden cardiac death / SADS has been a major public health issue recognised for decades.” In fact, a 2007 British study looked at 56 SADS cases from the late 1990s and the first documented case of LQTS dates back to 1856 in Germany. So, the story on which the suggestive social media posts are based is flawed, and there is no evidence of an uptick in SADS cases since the COVID-19 vaccines became available or that vaccines would cause SADS. Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation has no control over FactCheck.org’s editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation. The goal of the project is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines, while decreasing the impact of misinformation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"RFK Jr. Video Pushes Known Vaccine Misrepresentations\". [/INST] Several vaccine falsehoods and misrepresentations have been strung together in a video aimed at discouraging Black people from getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The hourlong video , called “Medical Racism: The New Apartheid,” is hosted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, Children’s Health Defense. It includes mostly rehashed claims about vaccine safety framed to exploit distrust of the medical establishment in Black communities. The video, which was made available on March 11, doesn’t offer any evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are harmful. Instead, it relies on innuendo — citing historical examples of ethical failures in medicine, misrepresenting various scientific studies, and suggesting that the medical establishment can’t be trusted. For example, Kennedy — who is a lawyer, not a doctor — ends the video by discouraging viewers from following the advice of public health officials, like Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . “Don’t listen to me, don’t listen to Tony Fauci, and don’t listen to your doctor,” Kennedy says before advising viewers to review the package inserts for vaccines and question whether the ingredients are safe. (See SciCheck’s articles on each vaccine: “ A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine, ” “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine” and “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine .”) Likewise, promotional material for the video baselessly claims that “[t]here are signs that history is repeating itself with the coronavirus” and questions , “Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?”  This is similar to the approach taken in another disinformation video we recently wrote about. In both cases, the videos acknowledge that Black people in the U.S. are suffering higher rates of illness and death from COVID-19, while simultaneously casting doubt on the vaccines that could curb the virus. Referring to Kennedy, Dr. Richard Allen Williams , founder and president of the nonprofit Minority Health Institute, told us in a phone interview: “It seems what he does is take old information and make a … leap to the present time and say what happened then is what is applicable to what is going on now.” But historical examples of unethical medical conduct are very different from the authorized COVID-19 vaccines. All three available vaccines in the U.S. went through clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants before the Food and Drug Administration granted them each an emergency use authorization. About 10% of participants in those trials were Black for two of the vaccines and about 17% were Black for the third . The trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards, and the results were reviewed by the FDA and an outside panel of experts. These tested, authorized vaccines are now available to the general population. Still, disinformation about the vaccines persists. For example, Williams — also a clinical professor of medicine at the UCLA School of Medicine — noted that when baseball legend and civil rights activist Henry “Hank” Aaron died of natural causes on Jan. 22, more than two weeks after he received a COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy “seemed to make an association between Hank’s death and his previous vaccination.” We wrote about the misleading comments made by Kennedy and his group at the time. “That’s an example of the dangerous thing he does,” Williams said, referring to the “harmful effects of influencing people to not take the vaccine.” We’ll address a few misleading claims used to promote the video and aimed at undermining vaccines. The video misrepresents a 2004 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that did not find an association between autism and measles, mumps and rubella vaccines. The study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics , looked at the age of children living in the Atlanta area when they received their first MMR vaccine and whether there was a correlation between the timing of the vaccine and a diagnosis of autism. If vaccines were contributing to autism, then one might expect to see more autism cases in kids who received the vaccine earlier, as we wrote about a similar claim. The study did not find that vaccines were causing autism. But Kennedy’s organization falsely claims that the “study discovered that African-American boys who receive the MMR vaccine ‘on-time’ by the age of 3 are 3.36 times more likely to be diagnosed with severe autism as Black boys who waited until they were older.” That’s not what the study found. That’s what a purported reanalysis of the data claimed to find a decade later. Brian Hooker — who has a degree in chemical engineering, not medicine, and has contributed articles to the Children’s Health Defense website — wrote the reanalysis for the journal Translational Neurodegeneration . But the paper was retracted just over a month after it was published. It’s worth noting, too, that his research was funded by Focus Autism, an anti-vaccine group now known as Focus for Health , where Hooker reportedly served on the board. Also, Hooker had filed a claim under t he National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program alleging that his son’s autism was caused by vaccines. The lawsuit was pending at the time Hooker published the paper, but was later dismissed in a 58-page opinion in which the judge said, “[T]his case is not a close call.” The judge found no connection between vaccines and the boy’s disorder. The paper was retracted because “there were undeclared competing interests on the part of the author” and there were also “concerns about the validity of the methods and statistical analysis.” Prior to publishing his paper, Hooker had spoken to Dr. William Thompson, one of the researchers on the original CDC study. Thompson had shared his concerns about the study’s process, but later explained that he did not know Hooker had been recording their conversations and had no control over how Hooker used the recordings. Thompson still works at the CDC, and when we reached him by phone, he referred us to his lawyer, Rick Morgan. Neither would speak to us on the record, but Morgan provided us with Thompson’s 2014 statement . It said, in part: “I want to be absolutely clear that I believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives. I would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race. Vaccines prevent serious diseases, and the risks associated with their administration are vastly outweighed by their individual and societal benefits.” So, the claim in the video uses a discredited paper to misrepresent the findings of a CDC study. In another distortion of scientific research, the video twists the meaning of a preliminary 2014 study that found some Somali Americans developed twice the antibody response to rubella after getting the vaccine compared with Caucasians. The Children’s Health Defense material , however, claims that the study, which was done by Dr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic, “means that African-American children are being ‘overdosed’ with today’s current vaccine concentration.” But that’s not at all what the study found, Poland told us in a phone interview. He explained that this claim is based on a hypothesis generating study, which means that researchers look at a small sample, make observations and speculate about what those observations could mean. Then they do a larger study. In this case, Poland said, “We haven’t done the larger study.” In 2014, Poland and a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic looked at 1,100 healthy children and young adults in Rochester, Minnesota, and more than 1,000 participants from the U.S. Naval Health Research Center in San Diego as the control group, as well as a group of recent immigrants to Rochester from Somalia. As we said, the Somali Americans developed twice the antibodies to rubella after getting the vaccine as their white counterparts. Since they haven’t done the larger study, researchers don’t know why there is a difference or what it might mean. It could mean that white children are being underdosed, Poland said, explaining that without further study it’s unclear. What is clear is that the claim from the Children’s Health Defense is wrong. “We do not have a study that shows African Americans need half the dose. We do not have a study that shows African American children are being overdosed,” Poland said. He described the claim as being “like a good conspiracy theory — it contains a grain of truth with a lot of speculations around it.” The grain of truth is that researchers found higher levels of antibodies in Somali immigrants, but the rest is conjecture. The higher levels may not have anything to do with the vaccine, Poland said. For example, the study subjects could have been exposed to rubella in refugee camps before arriving in the U.S., so the antibodies from the vaccine would have added to what was already in their systems. So, again, this claim is a misrepresentation of a preliminary study. The video also revisits a controversial clinical trial from 30 years ago. Several years after the study concluded, the CDC acknowledged it had failed to notify parents that one of the vaccines used in the study was experimental, and of the specific risks involved. “The Tuskegee experiment that took place from 1932 to 1972 — the CDC promised us that an experiment like this would never happen again, but yet in 1989 there was a Los Angeles Times article that came out that revealed the startling truth: that the CDC admitted that they experimented on 1,500 Black and Latino boys in Los Angeles — without the parents knowing that this was an experimental test,” Tony Muhammad, of the Nation of Islam, says in the video. That’s referring to a clinical trial for measles vaccines that the CDC conducted in Los Angeles on babies up to a year old between 1990 and 1991 — amid a measles epidemic that began in 1989. The CDC acknowledged in a 1996 Los Angeles Times story that the families involved in the Los Angeles trial were not informed that one of the vaccines used in the trial was experimental. T he majority of the children were African American and Latino, the newspaper reported. The study involved about 1,500 children, who received either high or standard doses of the Edmonston-Zagreb, or EZ, vaccine or standard doses of the Moraten vaccine, according to testimony to Congress in May 1997 by then-CDC Director Dr. David Satcher . The Moraten vaccine was already licensed for use in the U.S. during the trial. But while other countries widely used standard doses of the EZ vaccine at the time, it was new to the U.S., and the high-dose version was experimental. The CDC stopped the trial in October 1991 after separate studies in Senegal and Haiti suggested baby girls vaccinated with the higher potency version were at increased risk of dying in the two to three years following vaccination. Satcher, who was not director when the trial took place, said in his prepared remarks that the EZ vaccines that were used in the trial were approved for investigation by the Food and Drug Administration but that the consent form for families was “deficient.” He said a subsequent review by the Office for Protection from Research Risks (now the Office for Human Research Protections in the Department of Health and Human Services) determined the study was “scientifically and ethically justified,” but the consent form failed to identify “the EZ vaccine as experimental” and failed to provide an “adequate description of the foreseeable risks of the experimental EZ vaccine.” According to the Los Angeles Times , “the form did not say that E-Z was experimental or unlicensed. But a brochure that accompanied the form said: ‘This vaccine has been shown to be effective in younger children. Over 200 million children around the world have received this vaccine, but Los Angeles County is the first place in the United States where it is being offered.'” Satcher said in a follow-up effort with families, “parents were informed of the reason for the follow-up study, including the fact that some studies had found lower survival in those children who received high potency vaccine.” The CDC didn’t find any ill effects associated with the high potency EZ vaccine in its study. It did not identify any children who took part in the Los Angeles study and received the high potency EZ vaccine who “suffered a significant health problem that can be associated with the vaccine,” Satcher said. One child died about a year after receiving a standard-dose EZ vaccine, according to Satcher, and “experts reviewed the death certificate, the circumstances surrounding the death, and the autopsy report and all agreed with the conclusion that the death was in all likelihood unrelated to the vaccine.” Williams , of the Minority Health Institute, told us that the mistakes made were legitimate issues that shouldn’t be forgotten. But the effort to compare that situation to the COVID-19 vaccine was “a matter of apples and oranges,” he said. “It’s not logical to take the results of what happened in an entirely different context and apply it to our current situation,” added Williams, a past president of the National Medical Association , which is the largest and oldest association of Black physicians. It’s worth emphasizing, as we said earlier, that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have successfully undergone clinical trials that demonstrated their safety. Williams said that he believes the issues with the measles vaccines trial weren’t given sufficient attention at the time. But, he said, that doesn’t substantiate suggestions that the same thing is happening now. “It needs to be understood, there was a mistake made,” Williams said, in order to make sure “those kinds of mistakes are not being made” again. “In fact, there are all sorts of preventive measures” to ensure that kind of mistake doesn’t occur, he added. Satcher outlined some changes that were made following the trial during his 1997 testimony, including institutional review changes and the creation of a checklist of elements that are to be included on consent forms. The video also revisits the topic of vitamin D and COVID-19. It presents a clip of Fauci speaking in an Instagram interview , telling the actress Jennifer Garner: “If you are deficient in vitamin D that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection — so I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.” Fauci was speaking (at about 31:30) about infections in general, however — not the novel coronavirus specifically, as the video may imply. “My question is, why isn’t this being discussed, or why isn’t the CDC or the World Health Organization jumping on this as a potential solution to do more research around it?” Dr. Charles Penick , a family medicine physician, asks in the video. It’s worth noting that there are many studies under way looking into the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. As we’ve explained before , while vitamin D might be helpful in terms of COVID-19, there isn’t enough scientific evidence yet to know whether it can treat or prevent the disease. That said, health experts do advise getting enough vitamin D as part of a healthy lifestyle, regardless. Most of a person’s vitamin D is made in the skin by exposure to sunlight. One study published in October in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , which evaluated the vitamin D levels of 216 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, found that the hospitalized patients had lower levels of vitamin D compared with a group in the general population — although it didn’t identify a relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe disease among those patients."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Distort WHO Guidance on COVID-19 Tests\". [/INST] A recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation — with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated. But neither of those claims is accurate. Instead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or PCR , tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results . The distortions online also tied the purported change to U.S. politics. “An Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,” read a headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, “how can these entities ever be trusted again?” The story was shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . Another website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly told readers: “Right On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives.” That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times.  Many posts also cited a viral tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019. In his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs “to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,” because “t he current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.” One Facebook post sharing Samadi’s tweet claimed that the guidance proved “ they’ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.” As we said, the WHO guidance implied no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden’s inauguration is wrong. As we’ve explained before , PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article “ The Facts on Coronavirus Testing .”) The PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles. There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian MacKay , a virologist in Australia, told us in an email. The WHO’s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions “carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.” In a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that “[a] fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.” PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue — even positive results at high-cycle threshold values — experts say. For example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the “cycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.” Matthew Binnicker , a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn’t whether they are “false positives.” “PCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,” he told us in an email. “The test is doing what it was designed to do — detect the viral RNA in samples.” Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used “ to determine whether someone is, or is not, ‘infectious'” to others. In other words, the question isn’t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced. “Some would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,” Binnicker said. But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness. And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it’s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus. Michael Mina , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values “doesn’t mean they’re false positive, they’re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.” Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHO’s memo served as a reminder that “ you have to be discerning about how to evaluate” cycle threshold values. “And if you’re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making, [it’s important] to really know what it is you’re doing.” For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value — which could mean “you already were infectious and you maybe don’t need to be isolated,” he said. “But it’s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,” he added. “Or, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it.” (Antigen tests are a different type of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.) Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation. Jessica McDonald contributed to this article.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Health Sensors Misconstrued as Government Tracking ‘Microchips’\". [/INST] A California company called Profusa is using federal grant money to develop sensors that would monitor the wearer’s health if they choose to use it. Dr. Matt Hepburn, a Department of Defense infectious disease physician, mentioned the project in a “ 60 Minutes” episode reporting on various government projects aimed at ending the COVID-19 pandemic and preventing future outbreaks. The show was careful to make clear that the device is “not some dreaded government microchip to track your every move, but a tissue-like gel engineered to continuously test your blood.” But, still, the segment has become fodder for conspiracy theorists and misinformation profiteers who claim that it’s evidence of government plans to track people with microchips. One of the first such examples of this claim came from Ben Swann, a purveyor of dubious claims and conspiracy theories whom we’ve written about before. “For almost a year, we have heard from so many so-called conspiracy theorists how the COVID vaccine is going to contain a microchip because the government wants to track you,” Swann said in a video shared on his private platform and on YouTube . “Of course we’ve heard that that’s all crazy. And yet, on Sunday, a new report from ’60 Minutes’ includes an interview with a scientist from the Pentagon who says that there is now a COVID microchip.” Swann made the same claim in a segment on the Russia-based, government-funded TV network RT, formerly Russia Today, which describes him as the network’s “investigative journalist.” Although Swann’s claim came shortly after the “60 Minutes” segment aired in April, similar versions continue to be repeated on social media. For example, Ben Irawan, an Australian pastor who sought political office in 2019 on the Australian Conservatives line, posted a clip of the “60 Minutes” segment on his Facebook page and directed viewers to his Telegram account, which he says he created “due to censorship.” He posted the same clip on Telegram with a message that referenced the biblical “mark of the beast,” which has become a common means of discrediting COVID-19 vaccines to religious audiences who incorrectly believe the vaccines contain a microchip. But, in reality, the sensor Hepburn mentioned isn’t a microchip, it isn’t related to the vaccine, and it isn’t even commercially available in the U.S. Here’s what it is: A small gel sensor inserted under the skin that can monitor body chemistry when paired with a separate device. It was developed by Profusa with the help of a $7.5 million Department of Defense grant in 2016, but is still in clinical trials in the U.S. In a phone interview, Hepburn described the sensor as has having a “squishy, rubbery texture.” It doesn’t have metal or electronic components, he said, and it would have no way of tracking or communicating a person’s location. The sensor can detect only one thing at a time, Hepburn said — like glucose, for example, which would be useful for diabetics who typically have to prick their fingers to monitor their blood sugar levels. The changes that it detects can be read only by a specifically designed device held up to the skin, Hepburn said. That device would then communicate the information to an app installed on the user’s phone. The device itself doesn’t have the capability to track a person’s location, he said, but smartphones are often equipped with apps that track their users’ locations. As with existing apps that track location, though, it’s the user’s choice to agree to those terms and use the app. It’s also important to note that the sensor can’t detect pathogens, Hepburn said, so it couldn’t detect COVID-19. But it could potentially sense chemical changes in the body that indicate viral, bacterial, or fungal infection early on. So, the sensor may be able to be used as an early signal for severe infections. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, is funding two clinical studies to see if the sensor could be used in this way to detect disease following a bio-terror event, Jared Adams , a DARPA spokesman, told us in an email. DARPA is an agency within the Department of Defense that supports research and development of new technologies that could bolster national security. In the past, DARPA invested in Moderna’s mRNA vaccine technology. Similar to Hepburn, Adams explained that the sensor “is inert, does not have any electrical components, and is of similar material to a contact lens or corneal implant.” He also said, “For these reasons, there is no such thing as a ‘biochip’ the government could use to track people.” Currently, one version of the Profusa system has been approved for use in the European Union. That system monitors tissue oxygen levels. It is still in the clinical trial phase in the U.S. So, it’s wrong to claim this sensor is actually a microchip that will be installed by the government to track people’s movements. As we said, the sensor inserted below the skin doesn’t have the ability to track movement and, if it does get approved for use in the U.S., it would be anyone’s choice to use it.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Data to Falsely Claim Italy Reduced Its COVID-19 Death Count\". [/INST] There have been more than 130,000 COVID-19 deaths in Italy from the beginning of the pandemic through Oct. 5, according to the latest in a series of reports from the Italian National Institute of Health. The reports break down the most common comorbidities, or other medical conditions, for those who died with the disease. A misrepresentation of that report has now filtered through several websites and was recently shared by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that formed in the summer of 2020 and has spread falsehoods about COVID-19 treatments, public health precautions and vaccines. We’ve written about some of its claims before. The group’s Facebook page posted a screenshot of one of the websites that misrepresented the Italian report and added this message: “Italy drastically reduced the country’s official Covid-19 death count by over 97%. This means Covid killed fewer people than … an average seasonal flu. 2020. The Year of the Fraud.” That’s false. Here’s how the claim evolved: In February 2020, as Italy was becoming a COVID-19 hotspot , the Italian Ministry of Health issued a requirement that all deaths attributable to COVID-19 be certified by the Italian National Institute of Health , or ISS by its Italian initials. The ISS then created a working group , called the COVID-19 Surveillance Group, to do that. The working group regularly issues reports that examine data on COVID-19 deaths, including the most common comorbidities present in those who died. The most recent of those reports covers data through Oct. 5. It included information on comorbidities for a sample of patients who died in the hospital, finding that 2.9% of that sample had no other medical conditions before they contracted COVID-19. That’s not surprising. The more health conditions a person has, the higher the risk for developing severe COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained . But the Italian report was distorted by others. The managing director for a conservative Italian publication , Il Tempo , referred to that report in an Oct. 21 article that said: “only 2.9% of the deaths registered since the end of February 2020 would be due to Covid 19. So of the 130,468 deaths registered by official statistics at the time of preparation of the new report only 3,783 would be due to the power of the virus itself.” A British website we’ve written about before then cited that story in a post that claimed, “Turns out 97.1% of deaths hitherto attributed to Covid were not due directly to Covid. According to its latest report on Covid mortality, the Institute says COVID-19 has killed fewer people than the average bout of seasonal flu.” That website later ran a correction noting, “The author of the piece is effectively stating his opinion that only those who died of Covid without comorbidities (2.9%) should be counted as a Covid death, and then extrapolates from there to suggest that the ‘real’ Covid death toll over the period in question was only 3,783. This is all contrary to the report itself.” But another website, which has shared other dubious claims about the pandemic, had already cited the post, adding this headline : “Italy’s ‘From Covid’ Death Count Drastically Reduced By Over 97 Percent.” A screenshot of that headline is what America’s Frontline Doctors shared with its more than 100,000 followers. But Italy didn’t reduce its COVID-19 death count by “over 97 percent.” As we said, the report included comorbidity data drawn from medical records of 7,910 patients who died in hospitals, and 2.9% represented the share of those people who died with no other illnesses. As we’ve explained before , those with certain preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension, have a heightened risk for severe illness if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. “[T]he presence of chronic diseases in the elderly population is very common,” the ISS said in a statement responding to the claim. “In view of the fact that chronic diseases represent a risk factor for death from COVID-19 and that these are very common in the general population, it is not surprising the high frequency of these conditions in the SARS-CoV-2 positive deceased population.” For example, according to the ISS report, 66% of those who died had hypertension and 29% had type 2 diabetes. Just over 97% had at least one comorbidity. In the U.S. , 19% of those who have died with COVID-19 had hypertension and 16% had diabetes, according to the CDC. “It’s pretty rare that someone wouldn’t have at least one issue caused by coronavirus prior to their death,” epidemiologist and science writer Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz explained after a similar claim was promoted by then-President Donald Trump last year. That claim alleged that the CDC had reduced the COVID-19 death toll by 94%, but it was based on the same faulty presentation of data as the current claim about Italy. “[A]ll it means is that in 94% of cases people who had COVID-19 also developed other issues, or had other problems at the same time,” Meyerowitz-Katz wrote. In the U.S., the vast majority of deaths that mention COVID-19 on the death certificate list that disease as the underlying cause of death , Jeff Lancashire, spokesman for the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us when we wrote about last year’s similar claim. That means it was the condition that started the chain of events that resulted in death. Current data from the CDC show that COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death in more than 90% of cases citing the disease on death certificates, with the remaining death certificates listing it as a contributing cause. In Italy, COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death in 89% of deaths of people who tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the ISS statement . So, Italy hasn’t reduced the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19. The claims saying that it has are based on the same kind of misrepresentation of data that we wrote about a year ago.

[/INST] The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Jan. 7 in two challenges to the Biden administration’s attempts to expand the use of COVID-19 vaccinations among private employers and health care workers. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who is diabetic, chose to stay in her office and participated remotely in the court arguments that began at 10 a.m. The following day, Jan. 8, the Politico Playbook newsletter misidentified Sotomayor in a photo taken at a dinner in a Washington, D.C., restaurant on the night of Jan. 7 with Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Politico ran a correction later that day, explaining that the woman pictured was actually Schumer’s wife, Iris Weinshall . Though the information was corrected, social media posts that repeated the error hadn’t been updated as of Jan. 13 and others continued to share the mistake. “Justice Sotomayor, who participated in yesterday’s SCOTUS arguments remotely from her chambers, seen last night at Le Diplomate with Speaker Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Schumer and Sens. Klobuchar and Durban, per Politico,” reads a Facebook post that we archived on Jan. 10 and that hadn’t been corrected as of Jan. 13. “They are all laughing at us.” A post shared to Twitter on Jan. 8, which was still up as of Jan. 13, carried the photo with the caption, “ Justice Sotomayor, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi dinner last night in DC. Photo and headline story by Politico.  Now we know where Sotomayor got her talking points on Covid case before her court right now!! Blatantly partisan. ⁦ @GOP ⁩ ⁦ @SenRandPaul .” But Sotomayor, as we said, wasn’t at the Jan. 7 gathering at the restaurant. In addition to Politico’s correction, a spokesperson for Schumer told the Associated Press that Sotomayor was not at the dinner.

[/INST] Comedian Amy Schumer recently appeared on NBC’s “Tonight Show” and ABC’s “The View” to promote the new season of her Hulu show, “Life & Beth.” Following those appearances, some social media users commented on her looks and speculated about her health. Schumer responded in a Feb. 15 Instagram post reminding people that she has endometriosis — a painful condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. The condition “may affect more than 11% of American women between 15 and 44,” according to the Department of Health and Human Services. “There are some medical and hormonal things going on in my world right now but I’m okay,” Schumer explained. Schumer also wrote, “[T]hank you so much for everyone’s input about my face! I’ve enjoyed feedback and deliberation about my appearance as all women do for almost 20 years. And you’re right it is puffier than normal right now.” Despite her clear explanation, some social media posts have taken the speculation further, falsely claiming that Schumer “Says She Developed VAIDS After Third Booster.” The claim is spreading as a screenshot meme that appears to have been taken from a website called ThaiMBC, which appears to post dubious news and health content along with articles about traveling to Thailand. The pictures featured in the ThaiMBC post and in the social media memes show Schumer in a hospital gown. They were taken from a Sept. 18, 2021, post to Schumer’s Instagram account after she had her uterus removed due to endometriosis. So, the pictures shown in the posts have nothing to do with vaccination, and Schumer has made no such statement about vaccine-related illness. In fact, “ VAIDS ,” the ailment mentioned in the posts, doesn’t even exist. “There is no phenomenon that I know of ‘Vaccine-induced immunodeficiency syndrome.’ It is not a real syndrome,” Donna Farber , chief of the division of surgical sciences and professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, told Reuters . Similarly, Dr. Stephen Gluckman , a professor of infectious diseases in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, told the outlet, “VAIDS” is “absolutely not” a real condition. Update, Feb. 28: Schumer announced on Feb. 23 that she had been undergoing medical testing while she was doing her press tour and that she has now been diagnosed with exogenous Cushing syndrome , which is a hormonal disorder that can cause a person’s face to look full and round ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Story Twists Facts on Diagnosing Breakthrough COVID-19 Cases\". [/INST] As part of its efforts to track breakthrough COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently offered public health departments and labs guidance for when to send the federal agency samples from such cases. The agency defines breakthrough infections as those that occur when someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at least two weeks after they receive their final dose of a vaccine. Specimens from some of those cases are collected so that scientists can sequence the sample, which can identify specific variants of the virus .  A false claim spreading on social media distorts the facts on this issue, wrongly asserting that the CDC has changed COVID-19 testing procedures to no longer count cases among vaccinated people. The website Zero Hedge — known for spreading misinformation — ran a May 23 story headlined, “Caught Red-Handed: CDC Changes Test Thresholds To Virtually Eliminate New COVID Cases Among Vaxx’d.” It was shared on Facebook more than 13,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . The story was actually republished from a website called off-guardian.org, whose own post garnered more than 2,000 shares on Facebook. But the claims made in the story rest on a misrepresentation of what the CDC said. The piece begins by accusing the agency of “ altering its practices of data logging and testing for ‘Covid19’ in order to make it seem the experimental gene-therapy ‘vaccines’ are effective at preventing the alleged disease.” First of all, as we’ve explained , experts say the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use in the U.S. are not gene therapy. While some have made that claim about the mRNA vaccines — from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna — the vaccines do not modify a person’s genes. A Food and Drug Administration spokesperson also told us in a recent email that “ none of these vaccines are defined as a gene therapy .” And the vaccines have proven to be highly effective in clinical trials — and, so far, in real-world use. For more, see our SciCheck stories on the Pfizer/BioNTech , Moderna and Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. The viral story focuses on polymerase chain reaction, or PCR , tests — which have been used to diagnose COVID-19 — and the issue of cycle threshold values. The piece dubiously purports that high cycle threshold values have been responsible for false-positive cases that have helped to cause “ an entirely created pandemic narrative.” As we’ve outlined before , a PCR test works by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. The test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load — meaning more virus is present in the sample — will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles. There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian Mackay , a virologist in Australia, previously told us. The central debate among scientists in regards to COVID-19 cases detected at high cycle threshold values (meaning less virus is present) isn’t whether they are false positives, but how to interpret and act on those cases. For example, a sample detected at a cycle threshold of 45 could mean the person already had COVID-19 and is no longer contagious; though, alternatively, it could also mean someone only recently became infected. The viral story claims that “ NOW, and only for fully vaccinated people, the CDC will only accept samples achieved from 28 cycles or fewer. That can only be a deliberate decision in order to decrease the number of ‘breakthrough infections’ being officially recorded.” That’s not what the CDC has said about a cycle threshold of 28. Instead, the CDC said samples submitted for genetic sequencing would need to be at that threshold. Scientists use sequencing to decode the genes of the virus to better understand factors such as its spread and evolution. On its informational page for public health departments and laboratories, the CDC provides instructions for submitting samples to the agency for breakthrough infection monitoring. There, the CDC says: “For cases with a known RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value, submit only specimens with Ct value ≤28 to CDC for sequencing. (Sequencing is not feasible with higher Ct values.)” The threshold doesn’t pertain to deciding whether the test is positive or not. “The CDC is still counting positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular results with any cycle threshold value as it pertains to case counts,” Matthew Binnicker , a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, told us in an email. “However, for sequencing studies, laboratories need a certain amount of the virus’ RNA in a sample for the sequencing to be successful. In other words, if there is a low amount of the viral RNA present, the sequencing will not produce results that can be interpreted.” CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed told us the same. Reed said in an email that the “ Ct value ≤28 is not used to define whether a specimen is positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. The Ct value cutoff of 28 is only for submitting specimens that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 to CDC for sequencing.” “Different labs will use different cutoffs for deciding when to perform sequencing. However, the Ct value needed to perform sequencing will not vary by vaccination status,” she added. “In general, CDC uses the same Ct value cutoff for submitting other SARS-CoV-2 surveillance specimens for sequencing. That cutoff is set because at Ct values >28 it becomes increasingly difficult to successfully sequence the specimen because the RNA levels in the specimens are generally too low.” The viral story goes on to wrongly say that “being asymptomatic – or having only minor symptoms – will no longer count as a ‘Covid case'” if the person is vaccinated, even if someone tests positive.

That's a matter of dispute. While the former dean and a 2006 graduate now in the military say the policy had little real effect on recruiting, military recruiters clearly disagreed. The number of recruits in any given year at Harvard Law School is so small, we don't think citing the 2005 increase - by 2 from the previous year - settles the issue one way or the other.. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Satirical Amendment Cited in False Claims About Kentucky Abortion Law\". [/INST] Three years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , Kentucky passed what’s known as a trigger law that set up an abortion ban to take effect whenever the landmark decision legalizing abortion nationwide was reversed. Kentucky state Rep. Mary Lou Marzian was so strongly opposed to the proposed law that she submitted a spoof amendment satirizing it. She told a local newspaper at the time that she hoped the stunt would draw attention to the bill, which she believed was unnecessary and intrusive. “It’s none of our business, to interfere in personal and private decisions of women,” Marzian said. Despite her protest, the bill passed the state House by a vote of 69-20 and later passed the Senate. The governor signed it into law on March 26, 2019. It took effect on June 24, 2022 — the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade as part of its ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson , a case about a Mississippi law prohibiting most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Kentucky law makes it a felony to perform an abortion except for cases in which a doctor has determined “that such a procedure is necessary to protect the life of a pregnant mother,” according to a memo issued by the state’s attorney general. Marzian’s amendment — which was designed to be criticism rather than serious legislation — didn’t become part of that law. But, following the Supreme Court’s recent decision, social media users have shared the text of the satirical amendment as though it’s a currently proposed bill. The amendment was featured in a viral video on TikTok and has been spreading on Facebook and Twitter , where people have shared screenshots of the amendment with messages expressing concern about the impact it would have. The satirical amendment said, in part, “All women who are Kentucky residents, and of child bearing age, shall acquire a signed and notarized statement from a practitioner licensed pursuant to this chapter each month that states whether she is pregnant or not pregnant. … Any woman who is pregnant and fails to provide this monthly signed and notarized statement to the cabinet will be fitted with an ankle monitor for the duration of the pregnancy in addition to any arrest and fines.” When copies of her proposal started circulating on social media recently, Marzian took to Twitter to explain her intention. “Since Friday’s horrendous US Supreme Court ruling on abortion, I have seen several references to a satirical amendment I filed in 2019, when the General Assembly passed the trigger law that immediately stopped elective abortions once the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was made,” she wrote on June 27. “I vehemently opposed that law and in protest filed an amendment that would have required all women to undergo monthly pregnancy checks by the state,” she explained. “I of course never intended it to become law, and it was never considered (although I worry we’re getting closer to that reality).” So, the claims that Kentucky is considering state-mandated pregnancy checks are based on a political lampoon from 2019.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Misrepresent Video of IDF Aircraft Attack\". [/INST] During the Oct. 7 surprise attacks on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, at least 260 people were killed at an outdoor concert, the Tribe of Nova music festival near Kibbutz Reim, as we’ve written. About 240 Israelis and other nationals were taken hostage during the attacks at the festival and other locations in southern Israel. Since war broke out between Israel and Gaza, about 1,200 Israelis and more than 13,000 Palestinians have been killed as of Nov. 20, the United Nations said , citing Israeli official sources and the Gaza Ministry of Health, respectively. The majority of Israeli casualties occurred during Hamas’ initial attacks on Oct. 7. News reports about the attacks have included video of the aftermath of the violence at the festival and interviews with survivors . As rockets fell on the festival crowd, the attackers converged on the site in trucks and on motorcycles, firing AK-47 assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at the fleeing revelers, according to reporting by the Associated Press based on survivors’ accounts. But posts on social media , including a Nov. 9 post from conspiracy theorist Stew Peters, falsely claim that a video shows many of the festival-goers were killed by Israeli helicopter fire, not the Hamas attackers. “VIDEO PROVES and ISRAEL ADMITS it slaughtered its own people on Oct. 7th,” Peters falsely claims in the post on X, the platform formerly called Twitter . “Footage from Israeli helicopter shows the IDF killing many people at October 7 concert in Israel.” Peters, a conservative radio host, also has spread misinformation about COVID-19 and other topics, as we’ve previously written . The 14-second video clip in Peters’ post appears to be green-tinted, infrared aerial footage of explosions on the ground and people running from the assault. The text on the post claims, “IDF helicopters fired on civilians fleeing the PsyTrance Music Festival.” In addition to the video, the post includes a link to an Oct. 30 article in the Middle East Monitor, a website that says it supports the “Palestinian cause.” That article includes a quote that reads: “Israeli commanders made ‘difficult decisions’ including ‘shelling houses on their occupants in order to eliminate the terrorists along with the hostages.'” The quote is attributed to a security coordinator at Kibbutz Be’eri, one of the settlements attacked by Hamas on Oct. 7. But the aerial footage shown in the post comes from a longer compilation video shared by the IDF on Oct. 9 on X. The video shows aerial bombings at several sites in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 8 — the day after the Hamas’ attack on Oct. 7. The text on the IDF post, translated from Hebrew, reads: “Forces @idfonline Throughout the last day, Air Force planes have been carrying out extensive attacks along the length and breadth of the Gaza Strip, wreaking havoc on Hamas terrorists. In just the last three hours, about 130 targets were attacked using dozens of planes. The focus of the attack: Beit Hanon, Sajaya, Al Furkan and Rimal.” Those locations are in the northern Gaza Strip; two are neighborhoods in Gaza City. In response to the social media posts, the IDF told Newsweek in a story published Nov. 13: “On October 9, a video was published on the IDF’s official Twitter account describing IDF attacks in the Gaza Strip . The purpose of the strikes was to stop the murderous terrorists from penetrating into Israel to commit brutal and inhumane crimes. The viral post of an airstrike on the Nova festival is fake.” The French television network France 24 debunked the claims about the video shared on social media in a Nov. 14 broadcast. An analysis cited in that report found that the infrared footage of the helicopter assault was taken at a location 10 kilometers, or six miles, away from the site of the music festival. News reports have noted the possibility that Israeli forces fired on Israelis during their response to the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. In its Nov. 14 report, France 24 cited media reports that Israeli helicopter pilots had difficulty distinguishing militants from civilians on Oct. 7. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported on Nov. 18 that “according to a police source, an investigation into [the attack on the festival] also revealed that an IDF helicopter that arrived on the scene from the Ramat David base fired at the terrorists and apparently also hit some of the revelers who were there.” (The Haaretz article was translated from Hebrew by Google.) Responding to that report, the Israeli police issued a statement saying its investigation did not focus on IDF operations at the concert site and did not provide “any indication about the harm of civilians due to aerial activity there,” the Times of Israel reported on Nov. 19. We emailed the media offices of the Israel Defense Forces for an explanation of the video footage shared on social media and a response to the Haaretz report that a helicopter fired at Israelis. A spokesperson for the IDF North American media desk told us in a Nov. 23 email, “The Israel Police clarifies that the investigation carried out by the Southern District focused on the heroism of the police officers who acted to stop the massacre committed by Hamas. “Contrary to the misleading publication, the police investigation does not refer to the activity of the IDF forces, and therefore no indication was given of any harm to civilians caused by any aerial activity at the site. “The preliminary findings of the ongoing national inquiry, spearheaded by law enforcement and communicated to the international media, cast a spotlight on the profound and reprehensible acts committed by Hamas terrorists during the Nova music festival. Any effort to downplay the severity of these atrocities, as depicted in the misleading Haaretz newspaper publication, deserves unequivocal rejection,” the IDF spokesperson said. We cannot say whether there were any cases of friendly fire by Israeli forces responding to the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. But the social media posts that claim the IDF video proves “many people” were killed by the IDF at the music festival are false."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"FBI Access Request Is Not Evidence White House ‘Lied’ About Not Being ‘Involved’ in ‘Mar-a-Lago Raid’\". [/INST] The National Archives and Records Administration negotiated with representatives for former President Donald Trump throughout 2021 for the return of presidential records that should have been given to NARA when Trump left office. NARA was finally able to get back 15 boxes of materials from Trump’s team in January 2022. When NARA noticed hundreds of pages of classified documents in the boxes, NARA’s Office of the Inspector General on Feb. 9, 2022, referred the matter to the Department of Justice. The DOJ then launched its criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of the documents, which were taken to Mar-a-Lago – his private club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida — when Trump’s presidency ended. So that the FBI and other intelligence officials could review the boxes of documents that were transferred to NARA’s custody, the DOJ, as authorized by federal law, asked the White House to submit a “special access request” to NARA, the official custodian of presidential records. NARA said the White House submitted the request in April 2022 and access was subsequently granted to the FBI by NARA’s acting archivist. The request for access to those particular documents doesn’t have anything to do with other classified documents that were later seized from Trump’s Florida estate on Aug. 8, 2022, when the FBI executed a search warrant that was obtained from a federal judge. FBI officials sought the warrant after Trump and his representatives failed to return additional classified documents and presidential records that were still at Mar-a-Lago. However, some conservative commentators and groups have falsely claimed or suggested that recently obtained communications discussing the access request from last spring show that the White House was directly involved in, or had prior knowledge of, the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago last summer. “It appears the White House used this special access request, where the White House says, ‘Hey, we need to get access to the prior administration’s stuff to make a decision now.’ They pulled that stunt to get this Mar-a-Lago raid … so that they could go in there,” Dan Bongino, a conservative political commentator, said in a video posted to his website’s Facebook page on April 12. Bongino, whose Facebook video had received roughly 99,000 views as of April 18, based his claim on information obtained by the conservative group America First Legal. He said the information “reveals that the Biden White House was involved with the Mar-a-Lago raid, and that the NARA, the National Archives, misled Congress” about its own participation. America First Legal, which was started by former Trump White House advisers, made the same claim in the headline of an April 10 press release about emails and other records it recently procured from NARA through a request under the Freedom of Information Act. But the FOIA documents do not show that the White House was behind the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago last year, or that President Joe Biden and other White House officials were “lying” about not having advance notice that Trump’s home would be searched, as Bongino and others also claimed. America First Legal’s press release highlighted an Aug. 23, 2022, email it obtained from NARA. In the email, NARA’s general counsel, Gary Stern , informed his NARA colleagues that the Washington Post had published a story mentioning an email he sent to Trump’s representatives about a “special access request for the 15 Trump boxes” months earlier. “On April 12, an Archives official emailed [former White House deputy counsel Pat] Philbin and John Eisenberg, another former deputy White House counsel, to tell them the Justice Department, via the Biden White House, had made the request,” the Post’s Aug. 23 story said. “The email offered the lawyers the opportunity to view the documents as well, but said the documents were too sensitive to be removed from the agency’s secure facility.” In its press release , America First Legal went on to say, “It appears that the Biden White House and DOJ coordinated to obtain the Trump records and perhaps create a pretext for the law enforcement raid by way of a ‘special access request.’” But as we said, the White House’s request for access was about allowing the FBI to review the 15 boxes of documents that NARA took possession of in January 2022 – not any classified documents that would later be recovered from Mar-a-Lago. Once NARA discovered the boxes contained classified national security information, its Office of the Inspector General notified the Justice Department, which launched a criminal investigation. The DOJ then asked the Biden White House to request that NARA provide the FBI with access to the boxes. That’s because, under the Presidential Records Act of 1978 , executive branch departments and agencies, under certain conditions, can request special access to records in NARA custody through the sitting president, not through NARA. The Presidential Records Act is the same federal law that says presidential records are the property of the government and requires the archivist of the U.S. to take custody of all such records when a president leaves office. The White House, through its counsel’s office, formally asked NARA on April 11, 2022, to “provide the FBI access to the 15 boxes” that came from Mar-a-Lago, according to Debra Steidel Wall, the acting archivist. The following day, NARA informed Trump’s representatives that the agency would be making the documents available during the week of April 18, 2022. But Trump’s team then proceeded to block the FBI from gaining access by requesting extensions to review the documents to determine if any were covered by executive privilege. On April 29, 2022, the DOJ’s national security division explained to Trump’s representatives why it needed access to the documents. “There are important national security interests in the FBI and others in the Intelligence Community getting access to these materials,” the DOJ’s national security division told the Trump team. The national security division added: “According to NARA, among the materials in the boxes are over 100 documents with classification markings, comprising more than 700 pages. Some include the highest levels of classification, including Special Access Program (SAP) materials. Access to the materials is not only necessary for purposes of our ongoing criminal investigation, but the Executive Branch must also conduct an assessment of the potential damage resulting from the apparent manner in which these materials were stored and transported and take any necessary remedial steps.” Finally, on May 10, Steidel Wall wrote to Evan Corcoran, one of Trump’s representatives, and said that Biden, given Trump’s executive privilege claims, had deferred a final ruling on the matter to her. Steidel Wall then explained that, after consulting with the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, she determined there was no reason to further delay granting access to the FBI, rejecting the former president’s assertion of executive privilege. She informed Corcoran that the FBI would be able to review the boxes within days. America First Legal has argued that the special access request may have been used illegally in this case. “The special access statute authorizes special access requests to an incumbent president only when the records in question are needed for ‘the conduct of current business’ of the White House,” its press release said. “Providing documents to the DOJ for purposes of a criminal investigation is not the ‘current business’ of the White House.” In addition, Bongino’s video featured a clip of Jeff Clark , director of litigation for the conservative Center for Renewing America, who argued that the DOJ should have requested access to the documents via a subpoena, which is another option for gaining special access to presidential records. However, in her letter, Steidel Wall said that the conditions for granting access via a request from the White House were “satisfied here” because, as the DOJ’s security division explained to Trump’s team, access also was necessary to “conduct an assessment of the potential damage” to national security “and take any necessary remedial steps.” When they examined the contents in mid-May, FBI agents identified “184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET.” Steidel Wall’s letter detailing the access request is not new information, as some have suggested. For example, the Bongino Report’s Facebook post had the headline: “EXPLOSIVE FOIA Req uest Exposes Biden Lie About Mar-a-Lago Raid .” The request for FBI access has been public information for more than seven months. John Solomon, a conservative writer and another one of Trump’s representatives to NARA, obtained the text of Steidel Wall’s letter and published it on his Just The News website on Aug. 22, 2022. NARA published the letter on its own website the next day, and the letter received press coverage at the time — including the Washington Post story mentioned in the email that America First Legal featured in its press release. Furthermore, the White House’s request also was not the reason the Justice Department launched its investigation of Trump that led to the FBI searching Mar-a-Lago. “Until the White House did this, this was an administrative dispute between the Archives and Trump,” Tom Fitton , president of Judicial Watch, a conservative nonprofit organization, said in an April 12 interview with Glenn Beck. A clip of the exchange between Fitton and Beck has been viewed about 32,000 times on Facebook and over 49,000 times on Twitter. “The Biden White House intervened to allow a criminal investigation of Trump by the Justice Department. It wouldn’t have happened but for White House intervention,” Fitton said. But the access request came after the DOJ’s investigation had already begun. That was made clear in the affidavit that the FBI filed to convince a federal judge to issue the warrant that allowed agents to search Trump’s property. A redacted version of the affidavit, which was unsealed weeks after the search, says: In fact, on May 11, 2022, as part of the FBI’s investigation, Trump’s office received a separate grand jury subpoena for additional classified records that the government believed were still stored at Trump’s Florida residence. That happened before the FBI was finally able to review the first 15 boxes of documents about a week later. After requesting and being granted additional time to comply with the subpoena, a lawyer for Trump met with a DOJ lawyer and FBI agents who traveled to Mar-a-Lago on June 3. Trump’s representatives gave the officials an envelope containing dozens of additional classified documents that were found by Trump’s team in a storage room. According to a DOJ court filing , Trump’s representatives, in a certification letter, told the agents that a “diligent search was conducted” for “all documents that are responsive to the subpoena.” Counsel for Trump also told the agents “there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location” inside Mar-a-Lago, the DOJ recounted in the court filing. Following the meeting, however, government authorities “developed evidence” that more classified documents remained at the Florida property, according to a subsequent DOJ court filing. The FBI eventually requested the warrant to conduct its own search, and the search warrant was signed and approved by a federal judge in Florida on Aug. 5. According to the redacted affidavit , the FBI argued there was probable cause to believe classified documents and other presidential records remained at Mar-a-Lago, and that a search would yield evidence of multiple crimes, including obstruction. FBI agents executed the search warrant on Aug. 8, seizing 13 additional boxes that “contained documents with classification markings, and in all, over one hundred unique documents with classification markings … more than twice the amount produced on June 3, 2022, in response to the grand jury subpoena,” according to another DOJ court filing. On Aug. 9, the day after the FBI’s search, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a press briefing that White House officials learned of the search from news reports and that “no one at the White House was given a heads up,” including the president. “No, that did not happen,” she said. Biden later said himself that he did not have advance notice of the FBI’s plans. “None. Zero. Not one single bit,” he said while taking questions from White House reporters on Aug. 25. But in the video from his show, Bongino said the information America First Legal got through a FOIA request showed that Jean-Pierre and the White House were caught “lying” about being “stunned by the “Mar-a-Lago raid.” That information is not evidence that the White House knew the FBI search was going to happen. As Jean-Pierre said in an Aug. 29, 2022, press briefing , the access request for the FBI, which was mentioned in Steidel Wall’s letter and Stern’s email, is “completely different” from the search that happened later. The request was for the review of a separate set of documents than those recovered from Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents in August, and the request came after the Justice Department had already opened its criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of presidential records after leaving office. None of that means the White House used the special access request “to get this Mar-a-Lago raid,” as Bongino said, or that the FBI search “wouldn’t have happened” otherwise, as Fitton claimed. The FBI was merely following the law when it requested special access to records in NARA custody through the White House. Other fact-checkers have previously written about similar false social media claims."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Trump Left Biden a ‘Generous’ Note\". [/INST] A popular tweet that migrated to left-leaning Facebook pages wrongly claims that former President Donald Trump would not leave a note for his successor. In fact, President Joe Biden confirmed that Trump did leave him a letter. “No presidential note to be left behind from trump to Biden,” the tweet, originally posted Jan. 19, reads. It went on to say that there was “No First Lady Invitation to the incoming First Lady,” which appears to be correct; daughter Ashley Biden said in an interview that Jill Biden had not heard from Melania Trump about the tour and meeting between First Ladies that typically occurs on inauguration day. The tweet concluded: “These people leaving the White House are lowlife TRASH.” A screenshot of the tweet was then posted on the day of the inauguration on the “ Occupy Democrats ” and “ Being Liberal ” Facebook pages, where the post collectively accrued more than 7,000 shares. But the claim about the letter was proven wrong the same day. At the White House, Biden confirmed that Trump did leave him a letter, but declined to relay what it said. “The president wrote a very generous letter,” Biden said (3:16) when asked about the letter, after signing several executive orders in the Oval Office. “Because it was private I will not talk about it until I talk to him, but it was generous.” During a subsequent press briefing the same day, White House P ress Secretary Jen Psaki also said she was in the room when Biden opened the letter and called it “both generous and gracious” (8:29). The letter from an outgoing president to the incoming president has become a tradition during the transfer of power. Trump did break other traditions , of course, including his decision not to attend Biden’s inauguration.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Falsely Push Bill Gates-Connected ‘Air’ Vaccine Conspiracy\". [/INST] Some scientists are working on creating inhalable or nasal spray mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Such vaccines have the potential to better prevent infection or transmission of the virus than more typical vaccines that are injected. These vaccines, once authorized or approved, would be taken just like any other vaccine, with a person choosing to be vaccinated. But posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past . “The air vaccine will ‘indiscriminately’ force jab the entire planet with mRNA, delivering the toxic chemicals straight into a person’s lungs,” the post continues. As we have explained before , the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a good safety profile and aren’t “toxic.” The article proceeds to weave together a few true things — including the existence of some basic research at Yale University on an mRNA nasal vaccine in mice — to falsely suggest a Bill Gates-backed conspiracy is about to begin. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told us in an email that the claims in the article were “false.” Other posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates. In reality, no mRNA versions of an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in any country, according to our research, although some non-mRNA designs have been rolled out in places such as China. And scientists say it’s not possible to spray such a vaccine into the air and vaccinate people unwittingly. “It is not possible to do that and achieve vaccination, and it is not what we tested in our studies,” W. Mark Saltzman , a biomedical engineer and one of the scientists leading the work at Yale, told us in an email. The posts also sometimes cite a bioethics paper entitled “Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert” to argue that the conspiracy is more plausible. But the paper, which was written by a single academic, is specifically about moral bioenhancement, which the author defines as “the potential practice of influencing a person’s moral behavior by way of biological intervention upon their moral attitudes, motivations, or dispositions.” This is a theoretical concept, as currently there is no biological way to modify a person’s moral behavior. Moreover, the article is only arguing a conditional — that if moral bioenhancement is compulsory, then it should be covertly administered. It is not directly relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. The post “cuts up different pieces of information and pieces it together into a Frankenstein theory,” Dr. Angela K. Shen , a vaccine and public health expert at the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard David Institute of Health Economics, told us. “But it doesn’t really work that way.” As supposed evidence of the plot, the People’s Voice article cites an August study published in Science Translational Medicine by researchers at Yale University. “A team from Yale University developed the method for delivering the dangerous chemicals into people’s lungs,” the post incorrectly claims. But the study, which was performed in mice, is only evidence that scientists are working on developing an mRNA nasal vaccine. “This basic science study found that mRNA molecules delivered intranasally to the lungs of research animals can be used to effectively vaccinate against the COVID virus,” Saltzman said. “Contrary to reports on social media,” Saltzman said, spraying the vaccine in the air to mass vaccinate non-consenting people “would not work in humans and this study did not involve humans. Humans must receive a controlled dose that is administered directly into the nose.” Shen also noted that “when something goes airborne, it dilutes things,” making the prospect of trying to forcibly vaccinate a population by spraying a vaccine highly implausible. The Yale paper’s main innovation is the polymer nanoparticles used to deliver the mRNA into the lung. Alone, mRNA is very unstable, and won’t get past layers of mucus inside the body or into cells and do anything. At the same time, previous delivery systems scientists have tested have caused lung inflammation. This design appeared to balance those concerns, at least in mice. But more testing is needed, including in humans, before the vaccine, if successful, would ever become available. Shen, who is also a retired captain in the U.S. Public Health Service, estimated it would take closer to eight to 10 years for such a vaccine to get to market. Saltzman added that there was “no funding from Bill Gates or his foundation,” consistent with the funding sources listed in his study. The only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example. But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines. As pointed out in a summary of the November 2022 workshop on mucosal vaccines for COVID-19, even if such vaccines aren’t able to prevent infection entirely, they may still reduce viral shedding more than injected vaccines, which would reduce transmission of the virus. This, in turn, would more effectively limit surges of disease, lower the number of people who develop long COVID and reduce the risk of creating new COVID-19 variants. Another advantage of mucosal vaccines is that they are easier to administer. This is helpful to everyone, but could be especially valuable in poorer parts of the world. “A needleless delivery device is a better delivery method for lower and middle income countries,” Shen told us from Sierra Leone, where she is doing some work. Since many people are afraid of needles, a needle-free vaccine is also likely to appeal to many people who would like to be vaccinated, but can’t get over their fear. Relatively few mucosal vaccines exist, however, especially for respiratory illnesses. There is only one Food and Drug Administration-approved nasal spray vaccine. That vaccine, FluMist, uses weakened flu viruses to protect against seasonal influenza. There are no inhalable or nasal spray COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved in the U.S. The government, however, is putting money behind at least two designs, neither of which use mRNA — again, with the hope that these easier-to-administer vaccines would also better reduce spread of the coronavirus. Outside the U.S., there are a few non-mRNA designs from India, China, Russia and Iran with authorizations or approvals. China authorized the world’s first inhalable COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in September 2022. It is an aerosolized version of the company’s injectable vaccine, which uses an adenovirus — not mRNA — to deliver instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein. The inhalable vaccine uses an individual cup dispenser to transform the vaccine liquid into a mist that can be breathed in.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Falsely Claims 850 People Died of Myocarditis in Mexico\". [/INST] Multiple studies and safety monitoring systems have shown that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are remarkably safe. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, has been identified as a serious side effect of the vaccines, mostly in young males after a second dose. But acco rding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cases are rare and most of them resolve quickly. Myocarditis can also be triggered by a COVID-19 infection. Yet, the rare risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis has been mischaracterized over and over to spread fear and falsely claim mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous. A recent example is a widely shared video of a woman falsely claiming that in Monterrey, the capital of the northeastern state of Nuevo León in Mexico, 850 people died due to myocarditis in a two-week span. The woman does not directly link the deaths to COVID-19 vaccination but says doctors “are coming out” because the government and the media are “lying” by saying the deaths were caused by a heat wave and “because people already woke up, and they’re not going to be pushed around like they did during the pandemic.” “These doctors have grown some guts, and they’re saying that these 850 deaths in these past two weeks in Monterrey are due to myocarditis, straight up myocarditis,” the woman says. The comments on the original TikTok video, published by an account that has spread misinformation about COVID-19, show that people got the reference. “It’s the Jab,” one says. “Shots shots shots shots,” another reads. A more viral version of the video, republished on Facebook, adds crown emojis to the screen, a reference to the coronavirus. But it’s not true that 850 people died in two weeks in Monterrey due to myocarditis or from heat-related illnesses. Sonia Gómez, a spokesperson for the Health Ministry of Nuevo León, told the Associated Press the claim was false. We reached out to the ministry, but we did not hear back. The video distorts statements made separately, but on the same day, by two state officials. First, Luis Enrique Orozco Suárez, a prosecutor from the attorney general’s office of Nuevo León, said on June 27 that the Forensic Medical Service was out of capacity after receiving between two and three times the average number of bodies during a heat wave that affected the state that month. He said most of the deaths were caused by acute myocardial infarction, or heart attacks, but added that some individuals presented with several diseases. When asked if the heart attacks were due to the heat wave, Orozco said it was up to the health department to determine that. A myocardial infarction is not the same as myocarditis. A heart attack happens when blood flow in the heart is blocked or greatly reduced, usually because of a blockage in one or more arteries. This can cause irreversible damage to the heart muscle due to a lack of oxygen. Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, which can affect its capability to pump blood. Orozco didn’t say anything about myocarditis. That same day, a state official from the vital records office of Nuevo León falsely stated 850 people died of heat stroke in an interview with Telediario Radio . “Sorry, how many?” the interviewer asks in Spanish, in disbelief. “From two weeks to now, there are 850 deaths due to heat stroke,” said the official, named Miguel Gallardo, according to news reports . Gallardo added that the cause of death written in the death certificates was heat stroke. State authorities immediately dismissed the information. “The State Government categorically denies the alleged number of deaths due to the heat wave reported by the public servant Miguel Gallardo,” a state press release reads. According to statements given by the state health secretary, Alma Rosa Marroquín Escamilla, the next day, there were 36 deaths associated with the heat wave in Nuevo León from June 14 to 27. Marroquín told the media another 651 people needed medical care due to heat stroke and dehydration. According to a report published on June 19 by El Universal, the heat wave was one of the worst in decades, with temperatures reaching between 104 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 days as of the day of publication. The viral video shows several news clips in Spanish with the words “The GOVERNMENT IS LYING!!” on the screen. But those news stories recount this case of miscommunication — Gallardo incorrectly claiming 850 people died of heat stroke, state and federal officials denying that information, and the forensic service saying there had been many deaths due to heart attacks. The video twists those events to make the false claim that 850 people died from myocarditis."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Widespread Claims Misrepresent Effectiveness of COVID-19 Vaccines\". [/INST] Viruses mutate , or change, as they replicate. That’s largely why the currently available vaccine formulas aren’t working as well at preventing infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Those vaccines — made by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson — were highly effective in preventing both symptomatic infection and serious illness against early strains of the virus. But they are less effective against infection from the currently circulating subvariants of the omicron variant. Public health officials have acknowledged this shift and changed their advice accordingly, in an effort to deal with a disease that became the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020 and 2021 and has killed more than a million people across the country. But anti-vaccine campaigners and those who have cast doubt on the severity of COVID-19 have twisted those remarks to suggest that the health care establishment had given faulty advice about the value of the vaccines from the beginning. For example, conservative influencer David Harris Jr. — who has 1.5 million followers on Instagram — posted a pair of video clips featuring Brett Sutton, the chief health officer for the Australian state of Victoria. One clip is from April , showing Sutton encouraging people to get a booster shot, saying that it can help keep people from “getting infected in the first place.” The other clip shows part of a press conference from August, as Victoria was experiencing a surge in cases, where Sutton said: “Despite two, three, four doses of the vaccine, it’s not so good at preventing infection in the first place.” Harris didn’t include the dates of the clips — he labeled them only “Then” and “Now.” In the caption, he referred to his earlier claim that the COVID-19 vaccine “doesn’t work,” writing: “I wonder which of my other conspiracy theories will be proven true next???” Similar claims have been ubiquitous on social media and beyond. They’ve been posted on platforms such as the right-wing website Gateway Pundit, which claimed in a headline that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “finally admits their vaccines do not prevent anyone from getting or spreading the virus.” And they’ve shown up on a San Diego television station that has a history of promoting dubious claims about COVID-19. The station featured a guest who claimed the CDC had said of the vaccines, “turns out they don’t really work anyway,” and that CDC officials “knew they weren’t really going to do what we said they would.” That guest was Dr. Kelly Victory, who holds an active medical license in both Colorado and Ohio, but according to her LinkedIn profile has spent the last 16 years as a consultant for disaster preparedness training. She also campaigned against the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Victory has advocated against most public health advice over the course of the pandemic, claiming that “masks don’t work” and that asymptomatic spread “simply doesn’t occur with respiratory viruses.” In one talk radio appearance in 2021, Victory said that she had been “censored” for making those claims. But her claims just aren’t true . Other related claims have been pervasive online, such as the meme shared by Donald Trump Jr. suggesting that recently updated guidance from the CDC matches what those who have downplayed the severity of the pandemic and questioned the value of the vaccines had been saying all along. But the new guidance doesn’t indicate that health care experts were wrong about the vaccines or any other mitigation measures they had recommended. “The truth is, the effectiveness of vaccines shifted with each of the new variants,” Dr. Peter Hotez , Co-Director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. When the vaccines were approved for emergency use in 2020, they were approved based on their demonstrated ability to prevent symptomatic illness, he said. And large clinical trials showed that the efficacy was high. For example, the updated trial results reported to the Food and Drug Administration for full approval showed the Moderna vaccine was 93.2% effective in preventing symptomatic disease at least two weeks after the second dose in people 18 years of age and older. The vaccines were also highly effective when they were first introduced to the public in the real world. “The initial SARS-CoV-2 that we had, that initial wild type, the vaccine against it did work against infection,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said in a recent interview on Fox News. “It worked actually quite well against infection. It also worked against severe disease and death.” A promising early study from Israel showed that the vaccines had been more than 90% effective in preventing both symptomatic illness and asymptomatic infection in the early days after the rollout. “That was really exciting because it meant that, maybe, we could vaccinate our way out of this pandemic,” Hotez said. After the first variant, alpha, emerged, the vaccines remained highly effective against infection, severe disease and death, Walensky said. In May 2021, the CDC said that those who were fully vaccinated could stop wearing masks. Then the virus mutated, and the delta variant became dominant in the summer of 2021. Although the vaccines remained effective against severe illness and death from COVID-19, they were somewhat less effective at preventing infection from delta. That’s when the CDC reversed its recommendation and said that those who were vaccinated should wear a mask indoors. That fall, the Biden administration made booster shots available. The virus keeps changing, and subvariants of omicron are now dominant. It’s become increasingly clear that the vaccines are less effective in preventing infection than they had been with earlier variants. This is due to two things, Hotez said — changes to the virus and the natural decline in the potency of vaccination over time, which happens with most vaccines . The CDC noted the waning effect of immunity from the vaccines in an August report explaining the most recent changes to its guidance on COVID-19 prevention, which included a recommendation for booster doses. “Overall booster dose coverage in the United States remains low, which is concerning given the meaningful reductions in risk for severe illness and death that booster doses provide and the importance of booster doses to counter waning of vaccine-induced immunity,” according to the paper , which was published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Aug. 11. It also noted that the vaccines are “highly protective” against severe disease and death, and that they offer “minimal protection against infection and transmission.” That last part is what Victory and others highlighted, while neglecting to mention how effective the vaccines are against serious illness. Victory claimed that the CDC had “acknowledged” that the vaccines were “essentially ineffective.” But that’s not accurate. As we said, the CDC explained that being up to date with vaccination offers minimal protection from infection, but, importantly, significant protection against severe disease. Being up to date with vaccination means that you’ve gotten the primary series of doses and any boosters that are available for your age group, the CDC has explained . “Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” the CDC said. The rates of hospitalization and death are “substantially higher” among unvaccinated adults, especially those 65 and older, compared with those who are up to date with vaccination, the CDC also said. In fact, data from the COVID-19 Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network for March 20 through May 31, 2022, showed: “Hospitalization rates among unvaccinated adults were 3.4 times as high as those among vaccinated adults,” according to an Aug. 26 CDC report .

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Doesn’t Prove Capitol Police Allowed Jan. 6 Protesters to Enter Capitol\". [/INST] The Democrat-controlled House, with support from 35 Republicans, voted on May 19 to create a commission to probe the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol — though Republican resistance in the Senate may block the bill from passing. As political fighting over that inquiry continues, and federal authorities move forward with their criminal investigation , unsupported claims about the events persist online. One recent, widespread narrative falsely alleges that a new video clip depicts police officers granting protesters permission to enter the Capitol. But the footage in question does not show that. A May 16 story on the website American Greatness — headlined , “Video Shows U.S. Capitol Police Gave Protesters OK to Enter” — was shared on Facebook more than 7,000 times, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . The Gateway Pundit, a hub for misinformation , rehashed the claim in a story shared on Facebook about 1,600 times and repeated it in an Instagram post viewed more than 111,000 times. A radio show in Texas, “Walton & Johnson,” ran a similar May 18 headline . The American Greatness story cites a 44-second video clip, which the website uploaded to Rumble, that was taken outside the Senate chambers of the Capitol. It shows a police officer, identified as Keith Robishaw, engaging with a group of protesters — who, we note, are shown already inside the Capitol building. The article says that Robishaw “appears to tell” the “group they won’t stop them from entering the building.” But nowhere in the video clip does Robishaw say that. The clip shows a man telling fellow protesters that “police here are willing to work with us and cooperate peacefully like our First Amendment allows,” and encourages the group to be peaceful. It soon moves to Robishaw urging the protesters to remain calm. “We’re not against … you need to show … then show us, no attacking, no assault, remain calm,” Robishaw can be heard saying. U.S. Capitol Police in an email statement to us denied that the clip showed anything inappropriate. “There is no evidence of misconduct in the short video clip,” the statement said. “The officers are blocking the hallway and attempting to de-escalate the situation, as they are trained to, by telling the crowd to not attack or assault and to remain calm. The Department is working closely with its federal law enforcement officers to ensure the criminals who unlawfully broke into the U.S. [Capitol] during the Joint Session of Congress are successfully prosecuted.” The viral claim also fails to acknowledge the ample public evidence — including videos released by the FBI — documenting protesters violently assaulting officers at the Capitol, as law enforcement tried to prevent rioters from accessing parts of the building. Other footage show rioters breaking through a metal barrier outside the Capitol, as officers tried to hold it in place. Rioters were also captured on video breaking windows of the building to enter. The Justice Department has reported that about 140 officers were assaulted that day — about 80 Capitol Police officers and 60 D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officers. More than 400 people have so far been arrested in relation to the Jan. 6 events, and nearly 90 were arrested for assaulting law enforcement officers, according to the FBI. Some protesters and their lawyers have argued that some officers gave up or stood by during the riot, and that protesters thought they were allowed to be there. Whether any defendants can effectively make that case isn’t clear, but as we said, this particular clip doesn’t prove the protesters were simply given permission to enter the building. In its article, American Greatness reported that it “obtained the video from RMG News” and that the “44-second clip is reportedly part of a much longer video that has yet to be released.” We reached out to RMG News — which describes itself as providing “ adrenaline-filled, breaking news footage” to media outlets — for more context on the video clip. Howard Raishbrook , the agency’s president, told us in an email that it “often syndicates content given to us by freelance photographers and videographers. This was the case with the Capitol footage from January the 6th.” Raishbrook said the agency didn’t have anyone at the Capitol on its behalf, but that it accrued “81 minutes of content that HAS been released and seen by all network news stations. A lot of people have seen the content, paid for it, published it, aired it or discussed it around the world.” He said “ALL footage has been released. We are not holding anything back” — though he noted that the agency’s “entire content is not online anywhere.” He declined to provide us the name of the person who gave his agency the specific footage in question. In a video posted to YouTube by RMG News on Jan. 7, different footage from the same area of the Capitol shows protesters yelling at the same officers. One protester asks an officer, “What’s the point of stopping us at this point?” That officer responds, “That’s as far as it’s going to go.” U.S. attorneys in a January court filing in the case of Jacob Chansley — a QAnon supporter who also goes by Jake Angeli and who was seen at the Capitol wearing a distinct, furry headdress — said that “Robishaw and other officers calmed the protestors somewhat and directed them to leave the area from the same way they had entered.” “Most protestors complied, but Chansley disobeyed the order and instead began heading up a different stairwell towards the Senate floor,” they wrote. “Officer Robishaw, alone with more than 25 rioters in the Senate Chamber, attempted to engage with Chansley and asked for his assistance to use the bullhorn to get the protestors out of the Chamber.” Another video , taken by a reporter and published by the New Yorker , indeed shows Robishaw following Chansley into the Senate. Initially, there are only several protesters in the chamber — though the crowd later grows. In that video, as Chansley is on the dais, Robishaw can be heard asking, “Any chance I can get you guys to leave the Senate wing?” He adds: “I just want you to let you guys know that this is like the sacred-est place.” At one point, a protester says “you should be stopping us,” to which Robishaw responds that there are several protesters in the chamber, who would outnumber him. “I’m making sure you guys don’t do anything else,” he says. Seemingly responding to Chansley taking a photo on the dais, Robishaw continues: “Now that you guys have done that, can I get you guys to walk out of this room please?” So, in short, additional footage publicly available shows the police officer at the center of the viral claim following a protester into the Senate, then repeatedly asking the protesters to leave. None of the footage that we reviewed indicates he gave them permission to enter the building in the first place. Our colleagues at PolitiFact also reviewed the same claim, similarly finding that it wasn’t supported by the 44-second video clip. The author of the American Greatness piece, Julie Kelly, disputed that conclusion — tweeting that “ what is obvious to everyone who views this clip” is that “USCP, including a top official, tell protestors not to attack anyone and to remain calm.” But officers telling protesters already inside the Capitol “not to attack anyone and to remain calm” isn’t the same as police giving an “OK to Enter” the building. We reached out to the editor of American Greatness, Chris Buskirk , to ask whether the site stood by its headline about the video clip, but have not yet heard back.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Video Spouts Baseless Claim About Early Voting in Arizona\". [/INST] Early voting in Arizona began on Oct. 12, with more than 3 million voters requesting mail-in ballots or in-person early voting for the 2022 election. More than half of Arizona voters, or 57%, said they will vote by mail or absentee ballot, 10% will vote at an early voting location, and 32% plan to vote on Election Day, according to the Marist Poll. The poll also found that about 72% of Democrats and 53% of independents said they plan to vote by mail or absentee ballot, while only 46% of Republicans said they will vote that way. Conservative personality and author Lindsey Graham, also known as Patriot Barbie — not to be confused with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina — posted an Instagram reel on Oct. 23 advising Arizona Republicans not to vote early. She makes the baseless claim that voting early could show Democrats how many votes they will have “to fake” to win the election.  Data is available on the number of mail ballots requested and returned in Arizona by party registration. As of Oct. 31, the percentage of mail ballots cast by registered Democrats (39.8%) is slightly higher than those from registered Republicans (37%) and from voters who are unaffiliated or registered with third parties (23.2%), according to the U.S. Elections Project. Arizona law , however, prohibits the release of early voting results until all precincts have reported their results or one hour after polls close on Election D ay. Doing so is a felony. In addition, Arizona has measures in place to ensure the security of early ballots and the tabulation process. In the video , Graham focuses on the close gubernatorial race between Republican Kari Lake, a former TV news anchor, and Democrat Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state. “Arizona voters. This is why you vote in person. This is why you do not mail in your vote. This is why you do not vote early,” Graham says in the video. “I will say that when you vote early, I’m not making any accusations, but it does give the opposition the ability to say, ‘Hmm looks like, for example, Kari Lake has 2 million early voters. How many voters would we need to fake to catch up to that and surpass it?’ Just saying. Not making any accusations,” Graham says in the video. Graham shows a graphic of the “chain of custody” of a ballot. She says early voting and mail-in ballots go through six custody transfers before the vote is counted, while in-person votes go from the ballot being cast directly to being counted. She ends the video by saying, “This is why you vote in person on Election Day. Are we clear? Less opportunity for, oh, I don’t know, cheating.” Graham’s video has received more than 52,000 views and 6,000 likes on Instagram . But her claim that either party could determine how many votes were needed “to fake to catch up” is unfounded. Although the number of mail and absentee ballots requested and returned is publicly available by party registration in Arizona and many other states, it’s not possible to know how many votes were actually cast for each candidate until after the polls close at 8 p.m. on Election Day . Arizona’s election law says counting absentee or mail-in ballots can begin immediately after they have gone through processing and been delivered to the e arly election board. But the law states, “In no event shall partial or complete tallies of the early election board be released or divulged before all precincts have reported or one hour after the closing of the polls on election day, whichever occurs first, and any person who unlawfully releases information regarding vote tallies or who possesses a tally sheet or summary without authorization from the recorder or officer in charge of elections is guilty of a class 6 felony.” Following the 2020 presidential election, a spotlight fell on Arizona, as former President Donald Trump and other Republicans baselessly cited voter fraud as the reason for Trump’s loss in the state. An audit of ballots and a forensic audit of voting equipment were conducted in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous county. The audits found no evidence of fraud and confirmed that Joe Biden had won in Arizona. Republican claims of voter fraud continue, but Arizona has several levels of protection in place to ensure the safety and validity of mail-in ballots and the voting process. Matthew Roberts, communications manager for the Maricopa County Elections Department, told us in an email that the county has “ comprehensive policies and procedures that guard against votes being illegally cast.” “ Voting by mail is secure. Only registered voters may request a ballot in the mail ,” Roberts said. “ Each Maricopa County ballot is individually verified regardless of whether it is cast in-person at a Vote Center, or returned by mail. Only verified ballots are counted.” “When it comes to casting a ballot by mail, Maricopa County has internal controls and tracking methods for ballot security beginning from when the ballot is initially mailed, to how voted ballots are transported from the post office to onsite security and more,” Roberts said. “Maricopa County performs multiple audit checks before and after ballots are tabulated,” Roberts added. “All ballot affidavit envelopes require a signature that is compared against a known signature on the official voter registration file when received.” In order to receive a ballot-by-mail in Arizona, registered voters can either sign up for the Active Early Voting List or make a one-time request for a ballot. Sophia Solis, communications director for the Arizona Secretary of State, told us in an email, “E ach ballot has a barcode associated with a voter, which tracks the ballot from when it is printed, to when it is completed and returned to the county elections department.” A 2020 presentation by the Arizona Secretary of State’s Office says the state’s election security measures include paper trails for voting audits that verify each voter, keeping election systems unconnected to the internet, and conducting hand-count audits. In her Instagram video, Graham said that i n-person votes are counted directly after being cast. But that depends on the county in Arizona. For both in-person ballots and early voting ballots, the voter’s identity is verified before the ballot is counted, according to the Citizens Clean Elections Commission, which was established by state voters in 1998 “to improve the integrity of Arizona state government and promote public confidence in the Arizona political process.” Eight of 15 counties in Arizona use a “central count” method, while the other seven use a “precinct tabulation” method, according to information provided to us by Solis. In a “central count,” votes are transported back to a location used to count the ballots. In “precinct tabulation” counties, voters or poll workers run the ballot through a tabulation machine that saves the vote counts to a removable media device inside the machine, t he Citizens Clean Elections Commission explains . When the votes from the “central count” counties arrive at their location for counting, the votes and the poll workers are placed under a 24/7 live stream that monitors the actions in the room, which is required by law. The vote counts saved on a tabulation machine in a “precinct tabulation” county are transmitted to the central count location, where an election official loads the results into “the secure election management system and aggregates the vote totals for all voting locations,” according to the Citizens Clean Elections Commission . Solis said the “ tabulation process has numerous safeguards and audit mechanisms to ensure that results are accurate with how a voter casts their ballot.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Hospitals Overwhelmed by Another Surge of COVID-19 Patients, Financial Strain\". [/INST] The latest surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., driven by the delta variant of the virus that causes the disease, has pushed up the seven-day average of COVID-19 hospitalizations from 19,123 on June 15 to 80,664 on Aug. 15 — an increase of 322%. The hospitalizations tend to be higher in states with low vaccination rates, including Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. But a misleading Instagram post questions the seriousness of the pandemic and its effect on hospitals. “If there were truly a pandemic that was ‘overwhelming hospitals,’ then hospitals wouldn’t be laying off thousands of nurses who refuse to take an experimental vaccine,” the post reads. While some hospital staff have been fired for refusing to get the vaccine — notably at hospitals in Houston and New Jersey — the overall number dismissed for that reason is likely to be very small at this point, Colin Milligan, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association, told us in an email. Milligan noted that many hospitals have deadlines in late August or September for complying with mandates or deadlines that are tied to full approval of the vaccines. About 1,600 — a little more than a quarter — of all hospitals in the U.S. have some sort of vaccine mandate, Milligan said. “There really isn’t evidence that hospitals are shedding employees due to mandates,” he said. Earlier in the pandemic, some health care providers were forced to tighten their budgets and reduce staff due to lower overall patient volume, canceled elective procedures and higher expenses tied to the pandemic — not because COVID-19 isn’t real, as the post suggests. But Milligan noted that Bureau of Labor Statistics data show hospital employment has actually ticked up slightly by 11,000 jobs from January to July. Although still below the pre-pandemic high in February 2020, hospital employment was up 45,200 jobs in July compared with a year ago, BLS data show. The pandemic continues to put a severe financial strain on hospitals, however. More than 260 hospitals furloughed employees and at least 20 others laid off workers over the last year, according to Becker’s Hospital Review , a medical trade publication. A March report by the consulting service Kaufman Hall & Associates indicated that the number of hospitals operating in the red is likely to increase throughout the year and the financial health of rural hospitals will be significantly affected by the fallout of the pandemic. “We have not bounced back in terms of maintaining financial stability,” Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said when the report was released . “And — just as importantly — we are being set back in our ability to care for the sick, injured and keeping people healthy.” At hospitals hit hardest, doctors and nurses have been dealing with a flood of unvaccinated patients and are “no longer giving adequate care to patients,” Dr. Catherine O’Neal, the chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said at an Aug. 2 press conference . On Aug. 17, the Florida Hospital Association reported more than 16,000 COVID-19 hospitalizations, a 162% increase from the previous peak on July 23, 2020. “There can be no question that many Florida hospitals are stretched to their absolute limits,” Mary Mayhew, president of the Florida Hospital Association, said in an Aug. 17 press release, noting that “staff shortages” are compounding the problem. “While hospitalizations continue to increase, three out of four Florida hospitals expect to face critical staff shortages in the next seven days, an increase of nearly ten percent since last week, and half of our hospitals will no longer accept transfer patients from other facilities.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Misrepresent Victims of Hospital Bombed in Mariupol\". [/INST] After several days of bombardment of the southern Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Russian warplanes struck a maternity hospital on March 9, killing three, including a child, and injuring at least 17 people. An unidentified pregnant woman seen in widely shared images being carried away on a stretcher later died of her injuries, along with her baby. Another woman seen in photos from the bombing was social media influencer Marianna Podgurskaya. Podgurskaya was photographed bloodied and wrapped in a blanket descending a flight of stairs at the damaged hospital. She was transferred to another hospital, where she gave birth on March 10 to a daughter. Podgurskaya’s Instagram account shows photos of her pregnant, posted before the bombing, and the Associated Press has distributed a photo of her with her baby, Veronika. Yet photos of Podgurskaya and the woman who died were misrepresented in social media posts in Russia and elsewhere to falsely claim Podgurskaya was a paid crisis actor who posed as two different pregnant women. A Facebook post from an account called Rick Pickle claimed the photos are “indisputable evidence of the production of ‘shots with pregnant women,’ which is the responsibility of Ukrainian troll propagandists and their Polish media instructors.” The post claimed “the model Marianna … posed for the photo shoots in the ruins of the hospital.” It says she changed clothes and applied fake blood to appear to be a second pregnant woman. The disinformation campaign about the Mariupol bombing started trending on Russian Telegram, according to BBC journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh, and was repeated in a tweet from the Russian embassy in the U.K. The embassy said Podgurskaya “has some very realistic makeup” and could not have been at the hospital because it had been cleared. Twitter subsequently removed the posts . Russian officials sought to downplay the attack. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the hospital had not been operational and was being used by Ukrainian troops. Mariupol has been one of the hardest hit Ukrainian cities since Russian troops entered the country three weeks ago. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s office, said that more than 2,500 people had died in Mariupol as a result of Russian bombing, CNN reported.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Trump Won the Popular Vote, Contrary to Claims Online\". [/INST] On Nov. 6, the Associated Press called the 2024 election for President-elect Donald Trump. Trump won 312 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris’ 226 votes. While ballots are still being counted in some states, Trump very likely also won the popular vote, with 76.9 million votes compared with 74.4 million for Harris. Trump is the first Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote since President George W. Bush in 2004. But some social media users have claimed Trump didn’t actually win the popular vote. A Nov. 24 post on Threads shared the claim, writing, “Donald Trump losing the popular vote by 2% and only won because of the electoral college means that he is a DEI president.” (DEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion.) Another user shared the claim in a now-deleted Instagram post from Nov. 24 , which read, “DONALD J. TRUMP OFFICIALLY LOST THE 2024 POPULAR VOTE FOR POTUS.” In comments, the user explained that since Trump did not receive at least 50% of all votes cast, he had lost the popular vote. But this is a misunderstanding of how the popular vote is measured. In order to win the popular vote, a candidate must only receive more votes than any other single candidate — that is, a plurality of votes. They need not win the majority of all votes cast. Barry C. Burden , a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, explained to us in a Nov. 25 email, “Trump has not won an outright majority of the popular vote; that would require surpassing the 50% threshold. He has won a large plurality, which means that he attracted more votes than each of his opponents, but he is just short of a true majority.” On election night, it seemed that Trump had won a majority of votes. But as more votes were counted, Trump’s vote total fell to 49.9% of all votes cast and Harris received 48.3%, as of Nov. 26. Two third-party candidates — Jill Stein and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — received more than 750,000 votes each. As a result, neither Trump nor Harris achieved a majority of votes."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Spread Bogus Quote From Qatari Leader\". [/INST] When war broke out between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7, leaving more than 1,200 people dead in Israel, the Islamic state of Qatar issued a statement reiterating its support for Palestinian statehood and holding “Israel solely responsible for the ongoing escalation.” The statement also called for de-escalation by all parties and urged restraint. Since then, Qatari mediators have reportedly been engaged in talks to facilitate the release of about 200 hostages held by Hamas, including some Americans. So, Qatar has played some part in seeking to stop the violence since the conflict began, but social media posts have exaggerated that role. Social media posts have been spreading the false claim that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , the emir of Qatar, has “threatened that if the bombing of Gaza does not stop, he will cut off the supply of gas to the world.” There is no record of Al Thani making such a statement and the only evidence offered by those posting the claims is a short clip from a 2017 speech in which the emir referenced “the issue of Palestine,” according to a Google translation of the original Arabic. He did not say anything about stopping the export of natural gas in his speech, which was delivered six years before the war began. For example, a post from a conspiracy-theory account on X, formerly known as Twitter, shared the video clip with the claim “BREAKING: Qatar is threatening to create a global gas shortage in support of Palestine. ‘If the bombing of Gaza doesn’t stop, we will stop gas supply of the world.'” But, as we said, the video predates the war and doesn’t say anything about the export of natural gas. It’s also worth noting that oil and natural gas exports are the backbone of Qatar’s economy, so it’s unlikely that the country would cut off its own source of income. In 2021, earnings from Qatar’s hydrocarbon sector accounted for 81% of its total government revenues, the U.S. Energy Information Administration calculated in a March report using the most recent data available from the International Monetary Fund. “The strength of Qatar’s hydrocarbon sector … underpins the strong performance of the economy,” the World Bank wrote in an April report on the country. In another report on Qatar released in early October, the World Bank noted two major energy deals — one with China and the other with Bangladesh — saying, “These developments augur well for Qatar’s extended energy export prospects, with the likelihood of unveiling further energy contracts across Asia and Europe in the coming months.” Indeed, within the last week Qatar signed two more deals — one with Shell in the Netherlands and the other with TotalEnergies in France — for 27-year agreements to supply gas. In the first half of this year, Qatar was the world’s third leading exporter of liquefied natural gas behind only the United States and Australia, according to the EIA. Also, an anonymous Qatari official referred to the country’s liquified natural exports when he told Reuters , “such a statement has never been made and never would be. Qatar does not politicise its LNG supplies or any economic investment.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Sequencing Used to Identify Delta, Other Coronavirus Variants\". [/INST] The delta variant of the novel coronavirus — now the dominant version of the virus in the U.S. — has presented additional challenges as the country tries to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The highly contagious variant is responsible for a surge in outbreaks across the country, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. Vaccines still protect against the variant, especially against serious illness and death, but may be less effective against delta compared to other forms of the virus. Yet false and misleading claims have recently sought to not only cast doubt on the seriousness of the variant, but question its existence .  One such meme shared on Facebook more than 12,000 times misleadingly asks, “Since there is no ‘Delta Variant’ test, how exactly are people being diagnosed with the ‘Delta Variant’?” The same question was presented in a July 26 tweet shared by thousands that was posted by Errol Webber, a film producer and Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in California last year. Similar posts have been shared hundreds of times each. Adding to the misperception, at a White House press briefing July 30, Emerald Robinson, a reporter for the conservative outlet Newsmax, asked , of the delta variant, “How do you test, when — that it’s the dominant strain in the area, when people just test whether they’re COVID positive?” White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, seemingly perplexed, said “we don’t test it” and that “we listen to public health and scientists, and they tell us that it’s the Delta variant.” On Twitter, Robinson — who has nearly 400,000 followers — has since misleadingly claimed that “the Biden Administration is unable to provide any proof that Delta variant is real” and later that the administration “has no idea how to test for the Delta variant.” But the various posts trying to cast doubt on the validity of the delta variant betray a lack of understanding of how variants are being identified and tracked. There is testing to identify delta and other variants, but it’s more sophisticated than the routine clinical testing — often by polymerase chain reaction, or PCR , tests — used to simply determine whether someone has COVID-19. Dr. Benjamin Pinsky , an associate professor of pathology and medicine at Stanford University, told us in a phone interview that it’s worth first noting that “all the diagnostic tests are capable of detecting the delta variant — they just don’t distinguish it from different lineages.” In other words, the PCR tests do detect the delta variant as SARS-CoV-2. Identifying and tracking specific variants, however, requires additional analysis."

[/INST] Update, Aug. 27, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older. More than 565,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., but two effective mRNA vaccines are now available. Some treatments for certain patients, such as those hospitalized or receiving oxygen, have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies, and they continue to be studied. Since the pandemic began, however, politicized social media posts have featured doctors, some looking authoritative in white coats, spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The most recent example in this misinformation niche is Dr. Ryan Cole, who owns a medical lab in Idaho. Cole is featured in a video that has amassed more than a million views . He makes a variety of claims, some of which we’ve addressed before. The video was recorded while he spoke at a forum on March 4 hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Republican, and it was posted by a Libertarian organization called the Idaho Freedom Foundation. McGeachin was featured in an October post by that group, posing with a Bible and a gun in a video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign a statement saying that “any order issued in the future will be ignored.” Cole said in an interview with FactCheck.org that he’s “not affiliated with any political party, group or organization.” According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s office, Cole is registered as a Republican. In the March 4 video, Cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously, as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments. We’ll address his four main claims. Two of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. use messenger RNA, or mRNA , to train recipients’ immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19. ( See SciCheck’s articles on those vaccines: “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine “ and “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine .”) These are the first vaccines using mRNA technology authorized in the U.S., but scientists have been developing and testing mRNA vaccines for years, including in people during clinical trials. Still, misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online . To those bogus claims, Cole has now added: “mRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers. mRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases — not right away, six, nine, 12 months later.” We asked Cole to provide support for those claims, and he referred us to a 2018 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that reviewed trials and studies of various, earlier mRNA vaccines. But that paper doesn’t support his statement. Norbert Pardi , a research assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was the lead author of the paper. He told us in an email, “No publications demonstrate that mRNA vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.” Pardi’s 19-page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases, which is what Cole highlighted to us. The paper says: “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.” But, Pardi explained, he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns. However, he emphasized that “no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real.” It’s also worth noting that the paper predated the COVID-19 pandemic by two years, so it doesn’t include any information specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines. Simply put, “there is no scientific evidence that shows that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune diseases,” Pardi said. “Multiple clinical trials have been performed with mRNA vaccines in the past 10 years and none of them found that mRNA vaccination caused autoimmune diseases. Further, we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as Dr. Cole inaccurately suggests.” Likewise, Dr. Roger Shapiro , associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support Cole’s claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic. “There is nothing in the science of mRNA vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity, and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before COVID-19,” Shapiro said. “mRNA rapidly breaks down in the body, and probably does not last long enough to act as a carcinogen.” “Regarding autoimmunity,” he said, “this is always a concern with any medical product, but there is no evidence to date suggesting it, and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines. mRNA is made all the time in our bodies, and delivering it by vaccine should not be different.” Dr. Dean Winslow , an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke. In a phone interview, he characterized Cole’s claims about cancer as “fearmongering” and said, “There’s just no scientific basis for that.” “We’re talking about these very small fragments of messenger RNA that don’t hang around for long at all,” he said, noting that the mRNA vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been “very safe, very well-tolerated vaccines.” Winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mRNA from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long-term effects. So he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of RNA, which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Pardi told us, “COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter our DNA and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation.” Cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed a treatment for COVID-19 in order to “vend” a vaccine. (We’ll address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section.) “If there’s a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule,” Cole falsely claimed, suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to a treatment for COVID-19 so that they could instead profit from vaccines. “So, the NIH, who, you know, is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the ‘vaccine’ with Moderna,” Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an agency that does not approve medications. “If the fox is not guarding the henhouse there, I don’t know who is. That also is insanity to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody.” There are several problems with this statement. First, there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for a given disease, said Jorge Contreras , a professor in the College of Law at the University of Utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law. He asked, “Why would there be such a law?” Clearly there isn’t, Contreras pointed out, since the Food and Drug Administration authorizes a flu vaccine every year while Tamiflu , an antiviral drug used to treat the flu, has been available since the FDA approved it in 1999. “It’s certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for, there is no known cure for,” he said, noting that this is often the case with viral diseases, which are hard to treat. “But that’s not a legal requirement. That’s a scientific reality,” he said. As for Cole’s claim about the NIH, that agency conducts and funds research . It doesn’t approve drugs, medical devices or vaccines — that’s a function of the FDA. The NIH did collaborate with Moderna on the development of its COVID-19 vaccine. As we’ve explained , government researchers had previously been working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. The team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the NIH does research, it also files and receives patents , many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies. So, Contreras said, NIH’s patents stemming from research on mRNA vaccines are to be expected, and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected. Similarly, scientists from government-funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs. That’s normal, too, Contreras said. Generally, he explained, there are two reasons that the NIH licenses its patents to companies. First, the NIH is a taxpayer-funded institution, and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries. Second, the clinical trials required to bring a drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive, so, theoretically, making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products. So, Cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the NIH and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that it’s a “conflict of interest” to have the “federal government in bed with a vaccine company.” It’s actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government-owned patents. And he’s wrong when he says of federal agencies, “they don’t want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine.” There’s nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for COVID-19. Neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin — a common anti-parasitic medication — in the treatment of COVID-19. Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, has similarly noted that there is “[n]o scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.” But Cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is a “treatment” for COVID-19. He suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines, as we explained above. “We’re in farm country, horse country — you know, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses,” Cole said in the video, addressing an audience in Idaho. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals, but crossover use in humans can be dangerous. While Cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug, not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine, the FDA has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for COVID-19 has grown. Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, but the FDA hasn’t approved it to treat any viral infections. It is being studied with regard to COVID-19, though, according to both the WHO and NIH. “Treating COVID-19 with Ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use,” said Shapiro, the Harvard professor. “My understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems.” The trials so far have “showed no benefit or worsening disease, some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance, and some did show a possible mortality benefit; but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases,” he said. Winslow, from Stanford, cautioned that “there have been many claims for miracle cures” over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating COVID-19. “Ivermectin truly is a wonder drug for parasitic diseases,” he said, “but my suspicion is that it will be a lot like hydroxychloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, although studies found that it wasn’t an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients, as we’ve explained before. The problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are promoted as having broad-spectrum antiviral properties, is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells, Winslow said. Even potent versions, like remdesivir , which Winslow referred to as the “gold standard” of specific antiviral therapy in COVID-19 treatments, only accelerates the time to recovery, but doesn’t significantly reduce death rates or mortality from COVID-19. Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19; the approval is for patients requiring hospitalization. So, Cole’s claim that “there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication,” is unfounded. Ivermectin hasn’t been proved to be effective. Another of the major points that Cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin D could have in fighting COVID-19. “If you do not supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime, you are immune suppressed. Most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a vitamin D test, unfortunately,” said Cole, whose lab offers several vitamin D tests. After eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, Cole said, “What should public health message number one, two, and three be? Vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D.” It’s true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system. But that doesn’t mean it’s a panacea for COVID-19, as we’ve explained before . W hile a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit COVID-19 patients, as we’ve written. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent . A recent article from NPR looked at the research on vitamin D with respect to COVID-19 over the last year and found, essentially, the same thing. It also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or with becoming seriously ill . “While these studies raised hopes among some researchers, others are skeptical, noting that most of these are observational studies, not the gold-standard randomized, controlled trials,” the story said. “Much of the available evidence only shows association — not causation — and even those results are mixed,” Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NPR. In September, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Instagram Live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin D, “I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.” But, as we wrote before, excessive doses should not be used.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Trump, Allies Misrepresent FBI Order on Document Search at Mar-a-Lago\". [/INST] The standard policy of the U.S. Department of Justice on the use of deadly force is spelled out in the department’s Justice Manual. The section on deadly force begins by stating, “Law enforcement officers and correctional officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.” That basic policy is reiterated on the FBI website in its section on frequently asked questions. But lawyers for former President Donald Trump misquoted the policy in a motion, which was unsealed on May 21, in Trump’s classified documents case, the Associated Press reported . The motion said the operations order for the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 stated that “law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force when necessary” — omitting the word “only.” The release of the unsealed motion, with the misquoted order, was then shared by Julie Kelly, a writer with RealClear Investigations, according to Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler. Kelly posted on X, “Oh my god. Armed FBI agents were preparing to confront Trump and even engage Secret Service if necessary. … Gestapo.” But the operations order was just repeating standard Department of Justice policy, and there was no plan to “confront Trump,” who was in New York City during the search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Florida. “The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force,” the FBI said in a statement to the Associated Press. “No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.” In his fact-checking article for the Post, Kessler noted that Steven D’Antuono, a former FBI assistant director in charge of the Washington field office when the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, told the House Judiciary Committee in a June 7, 2023, interview that the FBI coordinated the search with the Secret Service “to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues.” D’Antuono said he was “adamant” that there would be no show of force — let alone use of force — at the former president’s resort. “It wasn’t even a show of force, right, because we were all in agreement. We didn’t do a show of force, right. I was adamant about that, and that was something that we agreed on, right, the FBI agreed on, right. No raid jackets, no blazed FBI,” D’Antuono, who has since retired, said. “We made sure we interacted with the Secret Service to make sure we could get into Mar-a-Lago with no issues. We’re not banging down any doors. We weren’t bringing any like FBI vehicles, everything that was reported about helicopters and a hundred people descending on, like a Die Hard movie, was completely untrue, right. That is not how we played it.” The release of the motion, with its mention of “deadly force,” sparked a firestorm from the former president and his allies. A May 21 post on Trump’s Truth Social account claimed, “Joe Biden’s DOJ, in their Illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.” A fundraising appeal on the Trump National Committee web page said, “BIDEN’S DOJ WAS AUTHORIZED TO SHOOT ME!” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of Trump, posted on X on May 21, “The Biden DOJ and FBI were planning to assassinate Pres Trump and gave the green light.” The claim spread on other social media accounts associated with Trump adviser Steve Bannon, including a May 22 Instagram post by the account @bannonswarroom, which said, “The FBI Raid At Mar-A-Lago Was An Attempted Assassination On President Trump.” But, as we said, the DOJ order contained standard language for a search like the one conducted at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, and the FBI coordinated its operation with the Secret Service. Trump and two of his employees, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, were indicted in 2023 on charges of mishandling sensitive classified documents and obstructing federal officials who tried to retrieve them, as we’ve written . The case is being heard in Florida by U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who has not yet set a date for the trial."

Cicilline and the Providence Police Department may have played a significant role in bringing the numbers down as well, but the scope of that effect is impossible to quantify with any certainty.

But those aren’t dangerous and are signs that the vaccine is working and the body is beginning to mount a protective immune response. More serious side effects can occur , but are rare.

In August 2021, it received full approval , after review of the manufacturing process and ongoing trial results and safety monitoring.  A flurry of articles and videos online are now misinterpreting a Pfizer document released by the FDA as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The posts incorrectly claim that it shows the vaccine is unsafe and is evidence that this was hidden from the public. “One year ago, these were side effects that Pfizer knew about,” conservative commentator Liz Wheeler says in an Instagram post , before highlighting a long list of so-called adverse events of special interest in the document’s appendix. “Look at how many side effects, adverse events, were recorded before the end of February of last year,” she said. “It’s shocking. It essentially admits that … this vaccine can cause you to miscarry your baby, this can cause you to die in any number of truly horrific ways.” A press release from Children’s Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, similarly highlights the appendix and calls the document a “bombshell” that “should put an immediate end to the Pfizer COVID vaccines.” John Campbell, a nurse educator in the U.K., whom we’ve written about before , also discussed the document in a popular YouTube video posted on March 9. In the video, which garnered more than 1.5 million views in just three days, he incorrectly implies that the vaccine caused the reported health problems. He also suggests Dr. Janet Woodcock , the acting FDA commissioner when the agency gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine, was wrong to say that “millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines.” “So how would you say it’s safe, when this document is indicating there’s been 1,223-associated deaths?” he asks. He, too, focuses on the appendix’s list of adverse events of special interest. “The list is long, quite incredible really,” he says. “Why weren’t we made aware of these at the time? Because if we were aware of them at the time, we could have had an index of suspicion for them and kept an eye out for them.” But, as we’ll explain, the appendix is just a list of conditions Pfizer was monitoring for, and the document supports the vaccine’s continued safety. All of these posts misunderstand what is being reported in the Pfizer document . The document is an analysis of adverse events, or health issues reported following vaccination, regardless of whether they were caused by the vaccine. Tracking of such events is useful for companies and regulators to identify possible safety signals, particularly of rare events that would not have been possible to detect in clinical trials. This particular document covers the first three months of the vaccine’s rollout, and incorporates adverse event reports from across the globe. Through February 2021, it says, there were 42,086 reports of individuals reporting adverse events, including 1,223 deaths. While on the surface those numbers could be alarming, it’s critical to understand that an adverse event is simply an event that has occurred after vaccination — it does not mean the vaccine necessarily caused the problem. And many of the events are likely to be purely coincidental. “By definition, an adverse event is a temporal association,” Dr. Paul Beninger , a pharmacovigilance expert at the Tufts University School of Medicine, told us, referring to the timing of the event. “Any health problem that happens after vaccination is considered an adverse event following immunization,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explains . “An adverse event can be a true adverse reaction, also known as a side effect, that is related to the vaccine, or a coincidental event that happened following vaccination.” Beninger said it was inaccurate for Campbell to say the reported deaths were “associated” with Pfizer’s vaccine. “ They’re temporally associated, that’s the reason why they were reported. But the assessment’s not there to show that they were causally related,” he said. “You cannot call them vaccine-associated.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Use of Floodgates at Southern Border\". [/INST] U.S. Customs and Border Protection opens floodgates in the barriers along Arizona’s southern border during the state’s monsoon season , which generally occurs from mid-June until the end of September. CBP uses the flood or lift gates to mitigate environmental problems and damage to the barrier structures . A CBP spokesperson told us in an email interview that the floodgates in the Tucson sector — which covers most of the state of Arizona — have been used for many years. “Fencing in the Tucson Sector was constructed at various times between 2009-2021,” the spokesperson said. “Throughout the history of the infrastructure, during monsoon season and ahead of potential heavy rains or flood events, CBP has opened stormwater drainage gates to ensure proper drainage and minimize potential impacts to the infrastructure. These gates prevent flooding and subsequent environmental, infrastructure and community damage.” “A compromise in the integrity of the barrier can lead to extensive damage making the gate, or even the infrastructure unstable,” the spokesperson also said. “When gates become damaged, they need to be secured open to prevent additional damage which can prolong the gap in the infrastructure. The unregulated flow of water can also undermine the integrity of the border road disrupting agents and emergency services ability to respond to illegal entries, smuggling and other criminal activity, or persons in distress.” Floodgates – which either swing open like doors or lift up like windows – are manually operated by CBP to allow water to flow through the border fencing. They were in use before and during the administration of former President Donald Trump, who had made a campaign promise to build “a beautiful, gorgeous, big wall” on the southern border, as we’ve written. While in office, Trump secured $16.4 billion to expand border barrier construction along the southern border — including $10 billion in redirected military funds, although $4.75 billion of that money was not disbursed before he left office, according to the Congressional Research Service. Over the course of his four-year term, Trump constructed 85 miles of new and 373 miles of replacement barriers along the border. The installation of new barriers during the Trump administration included fencing in the Tucson sector’s Lukeville area, where construction began in 2019. The new barrier in the Lukeville area was built with floodgates and the gates were opened in 2020 during the monsoon season before Trump left office, the CBP spokesperson told us. (An example of floodgates under construction during the Trump administration can be seen in a photo taken by Border Report at a different location along the Arizona border.) On his first day in office on Jan. 20, 2021, President Joe Biden ordered the federal government to stop using Defense Department funds intended for military missions on construction of border barriers. Biden later resumed building small portions of the border fencing in Texas, California and Arizona. But some social media users have misrepresented the Biden administration’s management of the border barriers , misleadingly claiming that this year’s opening of the floodgates was part of a plan to encourage illegal immigration. An Aug. 26 Instagram post from conservative commentator David J. Harris, Jr. , which has received more than 100,000 likes, shows a TikTok video of the floodgates open in the Lukeville area, with the text: “just in case you didn’t hear from the MSM one of those Dept in the Biden administration welded open border gates in Arizona.” Other social media users circulated the video, with one Instagram post using the hashtag #ImpeachBiden, while a commenter on another said, “I’m actually surprised they didn’t place voting poles there.” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas shared a photo of the opened gates on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, with a caption that claimed, “The Biden administration welded open the Trump border wall in Tucson, AZ. It’s not a crisis. It’s by design.” Cruz added his own comment: “This…is…nuts.” But as we explained, the practice of opening the Arizona border floodgates is not new and occurred during the Trump administration to address the effects of the monsoon rains. The Tucson sector has been the busiest sector for illegal immigration this year. Due to the surge in illegal border crossings, the CBP closed the floodgates in the Lukeville area — the border section highlighted in the social media posts — during the first week of September, weeks earlier than usual, NewsNation reported. Updated, Sept. 14: After our story was published, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers emailed us a statement saying it had “built and installed flood or lift gates as a component of all [Department of Defense]-funded border wall construction contracts. Pursuant to direction from the Department of Defense, USACE suspended construction of border infrastructure, including gates, in January 2021 and then terminated construction contracts by May 1, 2021.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Insurance Companies Provide Coverage After COVID-19 Vaccination\". [/INST] Three COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, and more than 163 million people in the U.S. — nearly 50% of the total population — had received at least one dose of vaccine as of May 25. ( See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine ,” “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine ” and “ A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.” ) Despite those numbers, and to the consternation of the U.S. insurance industry, a viral Instagram post has spread the falsehood that beneficiaries can’t collect the life insurance of people who had died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The post, uploaded by an account called texasseceded, reads: “My friends aunt recently died from the COVID vaccine. She was denied her life insurance because… she willingly took an EXPERIMENTAL drug.” We couldn’t determine the veracity of parts of this post — that someone’s aunt died after getting a COVID-19 vaccine or that a life insurance policy was not paid out for some reason. But the implication that life insurance would be denied solely because of vaccination is false. The American Council of Life Insurers, which represents 280 companies with 95% of the industry assets in the U.S., has been calling out similar bogus claims since March, Whit Cornman, an ACLI spokesman, told us in an email. “The fact is that life insurers do not consider whether or not a policyholder has received a COVID vaccine when deciding whether to pay a claim,” Paul Graham, senior vice president for policy development at the ACLI, said in a statement emailed to us on May 21. “Life insurance policy contracts are very clear on how policies work, and what cause, if any, might lead to the denial of a benefit. A vaccine for COVID-19 is not one of them,” Graham said. According to United Policyholders , a consumer advocacy group, there are a number of reasons a life insurance payment can be denied, such as lying about your health on an application or if a policyholder dies during the first two years after a policy goes into effect, known as the contestability period. “Life insurance policies are contracts that specifically state the obligations and rights of the insurance company and the insured,” Dave Wood , the Martin Chair of Insurance at the Jones College of Business at Middle Tennessee State University, told us in an email. “Some may limit cause of death to a certain cause (i.e. accidental death or cancer), but traditional policies don’t limit the cause of death. Exceptions include suicide if committed in the first two years after issuance of the policy, and war under some older policies.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has received unverified reports of more than 4,600 deaths among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, an alert system managed by the CDC and the FDA to detect possible safety issues in vaccines. As we’ve reported, social media posts and websites have improperly cited the raw data from VAERS as evidence that the approved COVID-19 vaccines cause deaths and serious events. But anyone can submit a report to VAERS, whether or not a vaccine caused the problem. “A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,” the CDC said . “However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.” As we’ve written , reports of a rare blood clotting condition, mainly in adult women younger than age 50, prompted the FDA and CDC on April 13 to recommend “a pause in the use” of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine “out of an abundance of caution.” The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted April 23 to resume the use of the J&J vaccine with a warning that it may cause the blood clotting condition. As of May 24, the agencies had identified 32 total cases among more than 10.2 million J&J vaccines administered. There have been three deaths linked to the blood clotting condition, as of May 7, according to the CDC. Graham, of the ACLI, told us in an email on May 24 that while his group has had to correct misinformation about insurance coverage in the past, he could not recall a situation like the false claim circulating on Instagram. “What concerns us about this falsehood is it may be leaving some consumers confused and questioning our commitment to policyholders and their families,” he said. “Life insurance is there to protect families financially if the unthinkable should happen.” As for the vaccine, Graham said people should get it. “Life insurers encourage all policyholders to maintain healthy habits and lifestyles, and taking preventative measures against COVID-19 is no different,” he said. “What’s most important to us is that policyholders know that nothing about the claims process or our commitment to them and their families has changed as a result of the vaccine.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

[/INST] Some conservative outlets have concluded or suggested that undercover federal agents or informants helped plan and carry out the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. But there is no evidence that happened. The unfounded claims largely originated with a so-called “ seismic exposé ” by the conservative website Revolver News, which encouraged members of Congress to question FBI Director Christopher Wray about the “possibility” that the Capitol riot was orchestrated by individuals working with or on behalf of the government. The June 14 Revolver News report said that the federal documents charging numerous alleged Capitol rioters with crimes mention “upwards of 20 unindicted co-conspirators” — “all playing various roles in the conspiracy, who have not been charged for virtually the exact same activities — and in some cases much, much more severe activities — as those named alongside them in indictments.” Thus, Revolver News argued, one of the questions Wray should have to answer is: “[O]f all of the unindicted co-conspirators referenced in the charging documents of those indicted for crimes on 1/6, how many worked as a confidential informant or as an undercover operative for the federal government (FBI, Army Counterintelligence, etc.)?” The article further said: “If it turns out the federal government did in fact have undercover agents or confidential informants embedded within the so-called militia groups indicted for conspiring to obstruct the Senate certification on 1/6, the implications would be nothing short of seismic. Especially if such agents or informants enjoyed extremely senior-level positions within such groups.” While the article hedged a bit, saying there was a “strong possibility” that happened, others have treated the suggestion as a confirmed fact — which it is not."

[/INST] For decades, Democratic presidential candidates have gotten more votes in densely populated, urban areas than Republicans, who have been favored in more sparsely populated, rural areas. The same trend held in the 2020 election , when President Joe Biden won 81 million votes, defeating former President Donald Trump, who received 74 million votes. Since Biden’s votes were more concentrated in population centers, he won far fewer counties overall than Trump, whose votes were more spread out. In fact, the counties that Biden won had 67 million more residents than the counties Trump won, according to an analysis from the Brookings Institute , which counted 551 counties for Biden and 2,588 counties for Trump. But in the weeks following that election — as Trump and his allies were spreading the false claim that Trump had won the election — conservative commentator Charlie Kirk suggested that there was something suspicious in the outcome because Biden had won fewer counties. The claim was recently revived by conservative activist Brigitte Gabriel in the days following Trump’s Georgia indictment , which accused him of conspiring to “unlawfully change the outcome” of the 2020 election. On Aug. 20 Gabriel wrote on X , the platform formerly called Twitter, “Biden won 477 counties. Trump won 2,497 counties. Who do you think won the election? Something isn’t adding up.” Gabriel got the numbers slightly wrong, but the real problem is in her mathematical reasoning. “The reason Biden won a clear majority of votes while winning a minority of counties is that his support was concentrated in populous counties,” Andrew Eggers , a political science professor at the University of Chicago, and his co-authors wrote in a 2021 paper that addressed several claims made in support of Trump’s false assertion that the election had been stolen from him. “As Democratic support has become more concentrated in cities, Democratic candidates have tended to win a smaller share of counties even as their share of votes holds steady,” Eggers and his co-authors wrote. “Thus, the supposedly incredible discrepancy Charlie Kirk highlighted is simply the continuation of a stable trend in US presidential elections,” the authors wrote."

By that gauge, although the U.S. had high deficits during Allen’s term, they were not close to record-setting. So Kaine’s statement is accurate in terms of raw numbers, but it frays when historical context is added.. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Tested in Clinical Trials, Despite Bogus Social Media Claims\". [/INST] All of the four COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. were tested in large, randomized controlled trials for safety and efficacy before the FDA granted them emergency use authorization and they were rolled out to the public. Two of the vaccines are now fully approved: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots. These are the vaccines the vast majority of vaccinated Americans have received. As is standard in clinical trials, the volunteers in the COVID-19 vaccine trials were informed of the risks and benefits so they could decide whether to participate, or what is known as informed consent. Yet a Jan. 7 YouTube video that racked up more than 300,000 views in its first three days falsely claims the trials were a sham. The video also incorrectly suggests the trial participants did not give informed consent. “A bombshell new report shows that the Department of Defense — yes the pentagon — controlled the COVID-19 program from the very beginning, and everything we were told was political theater, basically to cover it up, right down to the FDA vaccine approval process,” says host Clayton Morris, at the start of the video. “It was all theater. That means that human beings were used as props.” The 17-minute video is an episode of the YouTube show Redacted , which Morris co-hosts with his wife and which has previously trafficked in misinformation , including about COVID-19. Morris is a former “Fox & Friends” host and real estate investor who moved to Portugal following fraud allegations by former clients. The video features Alexandra, or Sasha, Latypova, who is described as “a former executive of a pharmaceutical contract research organization.” She has previously made media appearances with organizations opposed to vaccines, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Children’s Health Defense, and has written for the pseudoscientific website TrialSiteNews. In the Redacted interview, Latypova makes a series of false claims, many predicated on her misreading of government contracts and the legal code. Lawyers with expertise in the area told us the claims are bunk. Latypova kicks off her interview by claiming “the Department of Defense used very shady contracting practices and also used several laws that were put in place previously … to shield pharmaceutical companies, to not conduct, you know, proper clinical trials.” “As a result, we have this theatrical performance called clinical trials, but they were actually not real,” she continues. “Based on the laws that are used here and then involved in this process, clinical trials are not required at all. And, and in fact they cannot be conducted.” This is patently false. All of the vaccine clinical trials were very much real. Not only have thousands of Americans participated in these trials, some of whom have been interviewed for news stories, but there are reams of data from these trials that the FDA reviewed prior to issuing the emergency use authorizations and the approvals. These data were also reviewed by multiple independent review groups for the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in publicly accessible meetings, and the results were also published in peer-reviewed journals. The notion that these trials were not real strains credulity and requires conspiratorial thinking. Latypova’s mischaracterization likely stems from her misreading of the laws governing emergency use authorizations , or EUAs. It’s true that an EUA, which can cover a variety of diagnostics, treatments or vaccines during an exceptional situation such as a pandemic, is different from a full approval — and does not necessarily require a clinical trial. However, the legal code specifically says that an EUA can consider data “from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if available.” And for the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA made clear in guidance that clinical trials were required. An October 2020 FDA guidance document states that for a COVID-19 vaccine “for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure its quality and consistency, issuance of an EUA would require a determination by FDA that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its risks based on data from at least one well-designed Phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrates the vaccine’s safety and efficacy in a clear and compelling manner.” “For vaccines (and new drugs like Paxlovid, which also received an EUA) the FDA always requires clinical trials,” Villanova University law professor Ana Santos Rutschman told us. “Technically, guidance is not binding,” she added, “but we’ve never seen FDA depart significantly from guidance it issues in any of these areas.” And of course, trials were indeed performed for all of the vaccines that received an EUA, contrary to Latypova’s claim that they were fake. “The difference between an EUA and other forms of regulation is that the standard for effectiveness is that ‘it is reasonable to believe’ that a product is effective,” Rutschman explained. “‘Reasonable to believe’ is a lower standard than the one required for full approval; this means that companies are able to submit clinical trial data to the FDA sooner than they normally would under the full approval pathway. But the clinical trials still have to be ok’ed by the FDA, which also reviews all the data generated during the trials, and keeps monitoring the product even after it is authorized under an EUA, as well as after full approval.” “Sasha Latypova’s argument is a classic example of a causal fallacy,” Jacob S. Sherkow , a law professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told us. “Latypova assumes that because some clinical investigations are not required under an EUA, they could not have occurred.” “It’s bogus as a matter of law, as a matter [of] logic, and a matter of fact,” he added. Another of Latypova’s false claims is the suggestion that informed consent wasn’t obtained in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. She cites the 21st Century Cures Act signed in 2016 by President Barack Obama, saying the law changed “the informed consent requirements, such that subjects don’t have to be necessarily informed of what’s going on if it’s deemed not in their best interest.” Latypova proceeds to suggest that this is what happened in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. “They don’t have to inform the subjects what it is, they can use a lot of secrecy, they don’t have to run clinical trials, they’re not required, because these products cannot be investigational products, that’s what the law says,” she says, repeating her claim about the trials. “If they cannot be investigational products, then we don’t have any investigation, we don’t have any clinical trial subjects. So that’s how they’re pulling this off.” “[I]t’s just nonsense,” Sherkow said. “There’s nothing in the CURES Act that says, ‘No informed consent for clinical trials.’” Rutschman agreed, noting that the Cures Act allows for small modifications to informed consent in certain situations, but does not “do away with informed consent requirements.” Other scientists have published research analyzing the informed consent documents used in the COVID-19 vaccine trials. While the researchers concluded the forms should have been shorter and easier to read, it’s simply not true that such forms did not exist. Latypova’s related legal claim about “investigational products” refers to a particular part of the legal code about EUAs ( 21 U.S. Code § 360bbb–3 (k)) that states the use of an EUA product “shall not be considered to constitute a clinical investigation.” But Rutschman said Latypova’s interpretation of those words is “entirely incorrect.” Rather than meaning that an EUA product cannot be studied in a clinical trial, as Latypova has incorrectly assumed, the law is saying that an EUA product still needs to be studied or continued to be studied in a clinical trial to receive full approval, Rutschman said. “The provision is saying this is a particular pathway to bring products to market during an emergency, but use of these products is not a clinical investigation; if you’re going to seek full approval you have to continue running trials even as you make the vaccines/drugs available under an EUA,” she explained. Among Latypova’s numerous other false claims (we aren’t covering them all) is the suggestion that the pandemic was “planned” and that an unnamed “they” — presumably the government — want to relinquish control to the World Health Organization. “The pre-planning goes [back] years,” Latypova says. “For example, there is pandemic enterprise. It’s a quasi-private, quasi-government enterprise that’s been set up in 2013 that involves 10 heads of federal agencies.” She calls the group a “cabal” and claims the majority of the efforts were focused on maintaining secrecy. “It’s almost like they knew this was coming,” Morris interjects. “This is where we talk about conspiracy theories on the show. I mean, it’s all true.” It’s unclear which entity Latypova has in mind. The most likely candidate is a group known as the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise . It’s primarily made up of officials in multiple agencies, but includes industry partners, and helps to coordinate the government’s response during public health emergencies. It was created in 2006. In any case, it’s incorrect to suggest the COVID-19 pandemic was planned. Conspiracy theorists have made similar claims before, as we’ve written . The reality is that well before 2019, scientists and government officials had been concerned about pandemics, including those caused by coronaviruses. Trying to prepare for them is not evidence that they were orchestrated or planned. Near the end of the video, Morris suggests that “they’re already planning the next one” — presumably referring to the government and the next pandemic — and Latypova agrees. “The next important thing that they want to do is give up our sovereignty to WHO,” she says, referring to the International Health Regulations . We’ve explained before that the WHO can make recommendations for countries to follow during global health emergencies, but the WHO doesn’t have authority over countries to force compliance. It’s worth noting that while Latypova and Morris make much of the Department of Defense’s role in the COVID-19 vaccine program, there is nothing unusual about it. “DoD is always very involved in vaccine R&D,” Rutschman said, noting that historically, many vaccine-preventable diseases occur outside of the U.S. where American troops are often deployed. “[I]t’s totally normal for DoD to be the contracting agency; as funders, they have an interest in demanding that their funding recipients perform R&D that is compliant with FDA regs and likely to obtain authorization/approval if the resulting product is good.” As for the claim the Department of Defense used “shady” contracting methods, Rutschman explained that the contracting mechanism, known as “other transaction authority,” or OTA, simply allows the department to purchase items or services quickly — and is hardly unprecedented. “DoD had used the OTA pathway many times before COVID-19,” she said. “This form of contracting enables the government to move faster; it is perfectly legal and well-regulated.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Exaggerate Lab Findings About COVID-19’s Impact on Immune System\". [/INST] COVID-19 can be serious and life-threatening. But in many cases, particularly if someone is vaccinated, the disease is mild. While there is a real risk of long COVID — lingering or new symptoms after infection with the coronavirus, which can sometimes be debilitating — most research suggests people who recover do just fine. Studies show that most people who have been infected with the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, are well-protected against severe disease if infected again, with subsequent or prior vaccination offering even more protection . There is no evidence that COVID-19 has left large swaths of the population immunocompromised or unable to fight off either the coronavirus or other pathogens. Yet, as Slate has written , certain corners of the internet have misleadingly claimed that COVID-19 causes widespread immune dysfunction or immunosuppression that is leaving the entire population susceptible to all sorts of subsequent infections. In some cases, COVID-19 has incorrectly been likened to HIV/AIDS. The latest versions of these scaremongering claims cite a recent paper from a lab at Stanford University and an accompanying press release from the National Institutes of Health. “New study (but not news to anyone paying attention) finds that COVID can damage the immune system in similar ways as HIV or Hepatitis,” one Twitter user wrote . “What more do you want?” another Twitter user asked , sharing a screenshot from the press release. He continued: “how many times does it need to be shown? that’s the third study I’ve published TODAY showing this HIV like immune deficiency.” Both the paper, published in the journal Immunity, and the news release do include statements that could seem to support some of these interpretations. But the senior author told us the comparison to other viruses had been misunderstood, and the immune defect his group identified is not so severe as an immunodeficiency. Some scientists are skeptical of the results, and say the study is an outlier. “[T]here’s really no evidence … that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes long term immune damage similar to HIV or HCV,” E. John Wherry , an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email, referring to hepatitis C virus. “These claims are not based on solid data – either rigorous immunological assessment or real world manifestation of increases in other infections or diseases related to immune suppression.” The Immunity paper , which was published on March 15 and authored by Mark M. Davis ’ lab at Stanford, analyzed T cells found in the blood of people after COVID-19 vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 infection or both. T cells are one arm of the adaptive immune system. One subset, known as CD4 T cells, helps B cells make antibodies and helps coordinate the immune response. Another subset, known as CD8 T cells, kills infected cells to limit the spread of viruses. Using a highly sensitive method to fish out coronavirus-specific T cells from hundreds of blood samples collected at multiple time points, the authors found that compared with people who had been vaccinated, people who had been infected had significantly reduced CD8 T cell responses against the coronavirus. Vaccination after an infection helped, but the CD8 T cell response was still much lower than in those who had never been infected. “This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 virus infection may cause long-term damage to the patients’ immune system well after viral clearance,” the authors wrote. In their discussion, the authors made a comparison to infection with HIV and hepatitis C virus, noting that reduced CD8 T cell function has been observed in patients as long as a year after those viruses were either fully or nearly eliminated. This comparison was then highlighted in an NIH press release, which people on social media then quoted to lend credence to the false idea that COVID-19 is HIV-like. But the authors’ comparison is specific to a particular phenomenon with those viruses and their effects on CD8 T cells after total or near-total viral clearance. It doesn’t mean COVID-19 causes an immunodeficiency on par with HIV, which permanently damages the immune system by killing off a person’s CD4 T cells. “The damage we cited in our paper was more subtle,” Davis told us — “not on the same scale as the CD4 wipeout for HIV.” In fact, the Stanford group found no noticeable differences in the CD4 T cells from people who had been infected versus not. As Danny Altmann , a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, told us, the “immune effects of Covid are nothing like HIV at all.” While the comparison was misunderstood, some scientists criticized the authors for making it. “The scale of the defect in HIV and HCV is so much greater that I think anything that’s being reported here — even if we take it at face value — that I think that was a … risky analogy to make,” Paul G. Thomas , an immunologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, said in a phone interview. “I think that’s caused a lot of alarm and a lot of frantic press speculation that’s really not warranted.” A few scientists we spoke with were also doubtful of the Immunity paper’s results and critical of how the group interpreted its findings. Thomas, who published a paper in Nature Immunology in April 2022 that did not find any CD8 T cell defects, emphasized that the Stanford paper is just one of many other studies from groups using a variety of techniques that have come to opposite conclusions. “It’s not particularly representative of what many, many other studies have found, which have suggested that if you had a mild to moderate COVID infection, you’ve recovered, you don’t have long COVID,” he said, “then you should not be worrying about anything.” Wherry, the Penn immunologist, said the Immunity paper was “definitely an outlier.” “Most if not all other studies that have examined this issue carefully find the opposite or fail to come to the same conclusion. In fact, for what they specifically examined: infection followed by vaccination – there’s a lot of data that this ‘hybrid immunity’ is good,” he said in an email. “Moreover, these individuals are not more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 or anything else for that matter. There’s no evidence of immune system damage.” In most cases, Thomas explained, people with a mild to moderate COVID infection mount a standard immune response, and generate good immunological memory to the virus, similar to what happens with influenza. Vaccination on top of infection typically boosts “some aspects of that memory response,” he said. There are exceptions when there are problems with the immune system. People who have had very severe COVID-19 do sometimes have very low counts of T and B cells, for example. And with long COVID, there could be other immune problems, although those still wouldn’t be considered a full immunodeficiency. “In long COVID there is likely some immune perturbation,” Wherry said, “but exactly how that works has not been clearly defined yet.” Several possibilities might explain the Stanford group’s results, Thomas said, including the chance sampling of an outlier group of people, or the methods that the lab used. The lab used a unique approach for identifying the specific T cells. Thomas also said that based on what was written about the methods, it seemed patients were drawn from different studies, so it’s possible the blood samples might have been processed in slightly different ways. The authors themselves note in the paper that, as is true with other similar studies, it’s impossible to capture the full range of T cells that recognize the coronavirus, and their analysis was limited to the cells circulating in the blood. If more virus-specific CD8 T cells stayed localized in tissues after infection compared with vaccination, that would affect the results. Wherry said he had “serious concerns” about some of the lab’s methods, which include a technique not used by others in the field. He also thought the paper’s stated conclusions were “an over interpretation of what the data in the paper show.” “Bottom line,” he said, “is that others don’t see this.” Davis, however, defended his work. “The other studies were one-tenth the sensitivity of our study,” he said in a phone interview. “Which doesn’t completely explain why they didn’t see this, but we saw what we saw, and it would be irresponsible if we didn’t publish it.” Davis said he thinks his results “reflect some kind of long-term damage,” which might relate to long COVID. It is not yet clear what this entails or how it would manifest, he said, but one idea is that people could have a harder time recovering after a reinfection. While his paper suggested that the damage could apply to other infections, Davis said he thinks it’s likely to be specific to the coronavirus. That mention was included, he said, because the authors couldn’t rule out a broader effect, since they hadn’t tested for that yet. The data in his paper, however, only show a diminished response from CD8 T cells that recognize SARS-CoV-2. Davis said the main message for the public should not be fear, but to get vaccinated, since vaccination helped improve the impaired CD8 T cell response following infection. But he said he hopes scientists are spurred to investigate the phenomenon further. “I think everybody’s got to look at this and dig deeper and see what this might mean,” he said. Other scientists weren’t as critical of the Immunity paper. Altmann, of Imperial College London, said in an email that the study was from “a superb and reliable lab, and their answers stand.” He added that the work is “somewhat similar” to another paper published in January 2022 in Nature Immunology, which identified immune system differences the authors termed “immunological dysfunction” eight months after mild-to-moderate infection. However, Altmann noted that other “equally excellent research,” published in Nature in January, came to the opposite conclusion, finding that males who had recovered from mild COVID-19 actually had better responses to a flu vaccine than those who never had COVID-19. He cautioned against reading too much into any single dataset, particularly when research on COVID-19 has quickly outstripped that of any other disease. Regardless, scientists said it was incorrect to conclude from the Immunity paper or anything else that COVID-19 causes something as extreme as an immune deficiency. “[T]here are some nuanced differences for some T cell markers in some studies, but this [isn’t] remotely the same as immune compromise and currently, unlinked to any phenotype,” Altmann said, referring to any observable effect."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Increase in COVID-19 VAERS Reports Due To Reporting Requirements, Intense Scrutiny of Widely Given Vaccines\". [/INST] The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS , database has been fodder for anti-vaccine activists since before the COVID-19 pandemic. The reporting system, which is jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, is the nation’s early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines after they are rolled out to the public. Vaccines are always rigorously tested before widespread use, but the clinical trials can only be so large and cannot rule out rare safety concerns. For this reason, VAERS is used, in conjunction with a variety of other vaccine safety monitoring systems, to quickly identify potential problems, which are then investigated. Importantly, anyone can submit a report of a symptom that occurred following vaccination. The reports are not vetted for accuracy, nor do they mean that the symptom was necessarily caused by the vaccine. In many cases, the symptom is purely coincidental. These basic facts about VAERS, which are prominently advertised in a disclaimer that users must agree to before accessing the database, haven’t stopped people from misinterpreting the system’s data and using it to lend inaccurate or unsupported claims about vaccines a veneer of scientific and governmental legitimacy. And with the arrival of the three FDA-approved or -authorized COVID-19 vaccines, claims using VAERS have gone into overdrive. Television personalities , anti-vaccine websites and social media posts have all cited figures in VAERS or similar reporting systems abroad to falsely suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines aren’t safe, as we have written . The vaccines are remarkably safe — typically triggering only temporary and expected side effects that are signs that a person’s body is mounting the proper immune response — and are associated with only a few, very rare serious adverse events. In fact, VAERS has successfully helped to identify those rare but very real problems, which include heart inflammation for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines, and a blood clotting disorder coupled with low platelets for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — exactly as designed. The latest VAERS-inspired claim attempts to cast doubt about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines by highlighting the high number of reports to the safety system compared with past vaccines. “How can it be that adverse event reports input to VAERS are greater, since the COVID vaccines were rolled out, than all cumulative adverse event reports to VAERS for the prior thirty years?” a post from Children’s Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, suggestively asks. “Death reports for 2021 are also greater than cumulative deaths reported to VAERS over the preceding 30 years. Why has no public health official explained this?” A December post from Health Impact News, a website known for spreading misinformation about vaccines, makes the same insinuating argument. “There are now 927,740 cases reported to VAERS following COVID-19 shots for the past 11 months, out of the total of 1,782,453 cases in the entire VAERS database filed for the past 30+ years,” the post reads. “That means that 52% off ALL vaccine adverse reaction cases in VAERS for the past 30+ years have been reported in the last 11 months following the COVID-19 shots.” The figures, which reflected the totals in the database as of a few weeks ago, are accurate, although they’re cherry-picked to be as high as possible, as they include reports from abroad; more than a quarter of the COVID-19 reports are foreign. More important, experts say there are plausible reasons for why the COVID-19 total is so high — and because of VAERS’ design, comparisons between vaccines are invalid. The statistics are not proof that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous or significantly less safe than previous vaccines. The two posts are similar to a claim that USA Today fact-checked back in June, when the conservative website enVolve falsely said the “death toll” from the COVID-19 vaccines was more than 20 times greater than all past vaccines combined. They are also reminiscent of another baseless claim we addressed in February — again predicated on VAERS data — that a person is 300 to 900 times more likely to die “after getting the #Covid vaccine than the flu vaccine.” As we explained then, the huge number of VAERS reports following COVID-19 vaccination and relative paucity for other vaccines is likely mostly due to a reporting bias. For one, because the COVID-19 vaccines are or were at first authorized under an emergency use authorization, there are much broader reporting requirements for health care providers. For the COVID-19 vaccines, health care providers are required by law to report any vaccine administration error; any serious adverse event following vaccination, regardless of the suspected cause; any case of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome; and any COVID-19 case that results in hospitalization or death. In contrast, with all other vaccines, providers are only required to report select adverse events, including the so-called reportable events for each vaccine that occur within a certain time period after vaccination, such as an allergic anaphylactic reaction. Then, there’s the fact that the COVID-19 vaccines have been under intense scrutiny. “The pandemic has raised awareness of VAERs, the virus, and potential vaccine-induced adverse events to an all-time high,” Jeffrey S. Morris , a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania told us in an email interview for this story. “The extreme awareness, attention and concern about vaccine safety induced by the conditions of the pandemic in the past year could conceivably lead to much higher reporting than past years for other vaccines,” he said. “Thus, we can’t rule out that the greater number or events in VAERs may be a result of increased reporting and not a function of a more dangerous vaccine.” Part of this is standard for any new vaccine. “When a new vaccine comes out, there’s a lot of attention paid to whatever the profile is of those adverse events, so that the routine vaccinators understand what to expect as time goes on,” Dr. Paul Beninger , a pharmacovigilance expert at the Tufts University School of Medicine, told us. He said that there’s even a phenomenon known as the Weber effect , in which heightened awareness of a new vaccine leads to a spike in reports to safety systems such as VAERS, before rapidly declining. Reports to VAERS for one of the HPV vaccines, for example, shot up to triple the rate for all other vaccines combined between June 2006 and December 2008, likely related to media coverage of the new vaccine. But given that press coverage of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines is unprecedented in modern history — and that hundreds of millions of doses have been rolled out in less than a year, when most of the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use rather than a full approval — it’s reasonable to expect that any Weber effect would be even greater for the COVID-19 vaccines than for a typical vaccine. Indeed, part of the reason for the large number of reports is simply that the COVID-19 vaccines, which may involve as many as three doses, have been given to many millions of people. As of Dec. 21, more than 497 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the U.S., according to the CDC. That total is still likely well below the total number of all vaccine doses given since 1990, when VAERS began, but it’s a large number of shots given in a very short period of time, when awareness of the vaccines has arguably never been higher. Beninger also said that with the COVID-19 vaccines, the people administering the vaccines have changed. In the past, the most experienced vaccinators have often been pediatricians. But he suspects a shift to more inexperienced vaccinators has also contributed to increased reporting in VAERS. “Many people who are giving the vaccines are really very new to the whole vaccine paradigm,” he said. “They’re inexperienced in giving them and they’re inexperienced in assessing them.” “They don’t have the experience to say, ‘I don’t think this is related, so I’m not going to report,’” he added. “They’re encouraged to report. There’s some inflation.” As we pointed out back in February when we evaluated the similar claim about COVID-19 and flu vaccines, another factor potentially leading to more reporting than normal in VAERS is the population receiving the vaccine. While all adults and some children are now eligible to be vaccinated, the early emphasis on higher-risk individuals has meant far more of them are vaccinated. Dr. Paul A. Offit , a vaccine expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, told us then that because the vaccines protect against COVID-19 but were “not designed to prevent everything else that happens in life,” it’s expected that some number of people — especially the elderly — will die or have other complications, entirely coincidentally, after receiving a vaccine. Echoing Beninger, Dr. Robert Legare Atmar , an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine who also evaluates vaccines, told us then that during flu season, many of the everyday deaths of people in nursing homes, for example, might have been reported to VAERS this year if someone received a COVID-19 vaccine. In the past, however, a similar death during flu season would not be reported because it would not be thought to be related to the vaccine. Morris, the University of Pennsylvania biostatistician, also suspects that social media and misinformation — including posts sharing this kind of misleading information — helped fuel reporting to VAERS after COVID-19 vaccination. He has spent a lot of time during the pandemic debunking bogus claims about vaccines, including distortions of government data, which he shares on Twitter and on his blog . False but sensationalistic claims on social media, such as the vaccines magnetizing people or changing a person’s DNA, he said, “fed the mania about vaccine safety,” while so-called “vaccine safety alarmists” repeated anecdotal reports and analyzed VAERS data incorrectly to much the same effect. “All of this frenzy, fed by social media in a way that has never been done with previous vaccine efforts, raised worry about vaccine safety, which certainly would have led more to report to VAERs, perhaps more fraudulent reports from people with an agenda,” he said, “but also from people who are simply more aware of VAERs and more mindful of potential vaccine effects, who normally would not have associated the side effect with vaccination.” In that way, the posts’ creators themselves may have helped produce the very result that they are writing about — and are now using it to further undermine the vaccines. We asked the Department of Health and Human Services to explain why VAERS reports are so much higher for the COVID-19 vaccines, and the CDC replied, identifying many of the reasons as the outside experts. The three main reasons, the agency’s immunization safety office told us, were the different reporting requirements, the large number of people vaccinated in a short amount of time, and heightened public awareness. “COVID-19 vaccination is one of the top national news stories daily and VAERS has also been a frequent topic in media,” the safety office told us. The agency said that it “cannot always identify reports that are fraudulent,” but that it had observed a “huge increase” in hoax reports to VAERS. These reports are obviously false, list celebrities or state outrageous claims, and often do not include contact information for follow-up, the CDC said. The hoax reports, which are deleted, make up less than 1% of all VAERS reports following COVID-19 vaccination, the agency said. Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is illegal and can result in fines or imprisonment. The CDC emphasized that VAERS is just one part of a large network of vaccine safety monitoring systems. “It is important to note that VAERS is only one system among many that monitor the safety of US-licensed or authorized vaccines,” the agency said in an email (emphasis is the CDC’s). “Each system has different strengths and weaknesses.” VAERS, for example, is useful as a method of identifying purported safety problems, which must then be followed up in the government’s active reporting systems or in population-level studies, Morris said. Those active systems include the CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink , which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the U.S. to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time. “[T]hese have affirmed many of the events with high reporting rates in VAERs have similar rates in vaccinated and matched unvaccinated cohorts,” he said, so they show “no evidence of association or causation by vaccines.” Morris pointed to an Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine that identified the increased risk of myocarditis, or heart inflammation, in recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but also showed that the myocarditis risk for COVID-19 patients was higher — and found that many other serious adverse events thought to be potentially related to the vaccine were actually observed at similar rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated people. VAERS alone, however, can’t be used to know the frequency of adverse events, as its website explains , or to make comparisons about the relative safety of different vaccines. “That’s not the point of this database,” Beninger said of VAERS. “It’s not a comparative study.” Morris also said he had analyzed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data on the frequency of deaths among Medicare patients within two weeks of vaccination, and found that the rate in 2021 after the COVID-19 vaccines was “roughly equivalent” to the rate in 2018 to 2020 following the influenza vaccine. Both of these reflect a background rate of death. As he explains in a blog post and Twitter thread , a purported whistleblower had tried to use the data to argue that the death rate is twice as high after COVID-19 vaccination compared with the influenza vaccine. But that person failed to account for the fact that most Americans received a two-dose mRNA vaccine. As a result, far from proving the death claim, the data show the opposite — that there’s no sign the COVID-19 vaccines are any different from the flu vaccine — and what’s happening in VAERS is increased reporting rather than a sign that the vaccines are causing excess deaths. If the CMS data is accurate, Morris told us, it provides “rock solid evidence” that a larger proportion of deaths that occur after vaccination were reported to VAERS in 2021 for the COVID-19 vaccines than in prior years with other vaccines. Because no medical product is 100% safe, a very small number of people will be harmed by the COVID-19 vaccines, which is why it’s so critical to have a system such as VAERS and why it’s important to be transparent about the potential risks . But distorting and misusing VAERS figures to insinuate there are large safety concerns that have not been detected after administration of nearly half a billion doses in the U.S. is misleading.

[/INST]  During his campaigns for statewide Massachusetts office, Romney openly spoke of his support for -- to use his words from 2002 -- \"tough gun laws.\" As recently as the 2008 Republican primary, Romney said \"I don't line up 100 percent with the NRA.\" But since then, his pro-gun rhetoric has become sharper and virtually all nuance was erased. He even touted the bill he signed in Massachusetts by scrubbing any reference to the provisions banning assault weapons. Still, while Romney’s rhetoric has moved distinctly in the NRA’s direction, it’s not clear that his policy positions have changed. This is partly because Romney, even in the 1994 campaign didn’t take a full-blown, pro-gun-control stand. And even now, as his rhetoric has become more pro-gun, Romney has never gone so far as to specifically renounce his prior positions, such as his signing of the 2004 Massachusetts law, which at the time was billed as a compromise measure. So Romney’s shift has been more on the rhetorical level than substantive. He earns the rating of Half Flip.. ."

[/INST] The fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which began with Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, has raised fears of a wider conflict involving other nations in the Middle East . More than 9,000 Palestinians have died, the Gaza health ministry said on Nov. 2, and more than 1,400 Israelis have died , the Associated Press reported. In recent weeks, the U.S. has sent warships, aircraft and troops to the region. The increased American presence is intended to support Israel, protect U.S. forces already in the Middle East, and deter other countries from entering the war, Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Oct. 26. “I won’t talk specific deployment locations for these forces, I can confirm that they are not going to Israel,” Ryder also said. Meanwhile, a video posted on Instagram on Oct. 28 falsely suggests that it shows Russia is planning to provide military support to the Palestinians. The title on the video says, “Putin Announced Russia Will Openly Help to Palestine. No One Can Stop Us.” The video shows Russian President Vladimir Putin addressing troops at a military rally with armored vehicles and aerial displays of fighter jets and other aircraft. A comment on the post reads, “Here we go WWIII! Thanks Biden!” But the original video was not created after the start of the fighting between Israel and Hamas. It was made in May 2021 at a World War II “victory” ceremony. A translation of the transcript of Putin’s speech by the Russian media service Tass shows Putin was celebrating the May 9 Victory Day holiday, marking the defeat of Nazism in 1945. Putin did not mention Palestine, Palestinians or Israel in the 2021 speech. Putin has condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and warned Israel not to block aid from reaching the Gaza Strip, the AP reported on Oct. 25. He has also said Russia could play the role of mediator because of its ties with Israel and the Palestinians, the AP reported.

[/INST] Former President Donald Trump attended the March 28 wake for New York City Police Officer Jonathan Diller, who was shot to death while approaching an illegally parked car in Queens. One of the men in the car, Guy Rivera, of Queens, has been charged with first-degree murder of a police officer, attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Trump also met with Diller’s widow and 1-year-old son at the wake, the New York Times reported. According to NBC News, after the wake on Long Island, Trump talked to reporters about violent crime and said, “We have to get back to law and order. We have to do a lot of things differently because this is not working. This is happening too often.” (Trump’s comments about violent crime don’t reflect recent murder statistics in New York City. The number of murders citywide dropped 10.7% from 2022 to 2023. The number of murders in 2023 was also down 16.4% compared with 2020, the last year Trump was in office. This year, murders are down 17.2% , as of March 31, compared with the same time period last year.) While Trump did honor Diller and his family by attending the wake, social media posts are making an unfounded claim that Trump provided financial support for the officer’s family. “President Trump quietly paid off slain NYPD officer’s mortgage all while Democratic Presidents were attending a woke fundraiser,” reads the text on a March 31 Instagram post . (President Joe Biden attended an event in New York City on March 28 with former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton that raised $26 million for Biden’s reelection campaign.) In a video on the Instagram post, David Zere, a host on Real America’s Voice, is seen reporting from outside the Long Island funeral home. Zere says, “ Trump’s inside the funeral home right now. … But the story here is that, you know, Trump gave a donation to Tunnel to Towers. [I] believe he paid off the mortgage for this family through Tunnels to Towers and had a phone call with the family.” A March 27 Facebook post , from a person who frequently publishes posts critical of Biden, expounds on Trump’s purported gift to the Diller family. Citing information received from “NCPD Robbery Squad guys,” the post says, “My neighbor is a funeral director and is doing the wake for the NYPD cop who was killed yesterday. He met with the widow and the Department this morning. While she was in his office, Pat Hendry the PBA president says excuse me, she has to take this call. It was Donald Trump. A few minutes after that she got a call from the head of Tunnel to Towers, they are paying her mortgage off.” The post continues, “Donnie T donated all the $ to cover the entire mortgage.” But we could find no media reports or evidence that Trump paid for the Dillers’ mortgage, and Trump has not said he made such a donation. The Tunnel to Towers Foundation — an organization that “pays off the mortgages for the families of law enforcement officers and firefighters who are killed in the line of duty, pass away from 9/11-related illnesses, and leave behind young children” — issued a press release on March 28 saying that the foundation was covering the mortgage for the Diller home. The press release makes no mention of Trump. “The Tunnel to Towers Foundation has made a promise to pay off the mortgage on the Massapequa Park, Long Island home of NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller,” the release said. Foundation chairman Frank Siller said in the release, “Every day Officer Diller donned his uniform, there was a risk he may not come home. We will honor Officer Diller not only for his sacrifice but for his unwavering resolve to protect the people of New York City by ensuring his family can stay in their home, forever.” In response to the social media claims that Trump paid for the Dillers’ mortgage, the news website Greater Long Island reported a Tunnel to Towers spokesperson “said the foundation has not been in touch with President Trump or his team on this matter.” Also, Zere, of Real America’s Voice, posted on X on March 28, “I may have been mistaken about Trump donating the money to Tunnel and Towers for the Diller family. I had several people approach me this was the case. I apologize if I reported misinformation.” On a March 30 post on X, Zere said, “I retracted the story a few hours later….I did not originate this…i reached out to Tunnels to Towers and apologized.” CBS News reported that the Promise of Hope Foundation paid for Diller’s funeral costs, and the tip line COP-SHOT donated $10,000 for education expenses for his son. This year, 10 police officers, including Diller, have been killed by gunfire in the U.S., according to the nonprofit Officer Down Memorial Page. We reached out to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation and to the Trump campaign for comment on the claim made in the social media posts, but we didn’t receive a response from either."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Is Caused by a Virus, Not Snake Venom\". [/INST] A video that draws on several major COVID-19 conspiracy theories — and introduces a new plot to tie them together — has garnered millions of views on Rumble , a social media platform popular among conservatives. The video , which is billed as a “documentary,” consists of a single, roughly hour-long interview with Bryan Ardis, a retired chiropractor who sells purported acne cures online and, now, is selling a line of supplements called “ Anti-V ” — perhaps a reference to antivenom, although the website doesn’t explain. We’ve written about him before . The video is peppered with screenshots of scientific papers and news articles that Ardis cites to lend credence to his false claims. But none of them actually provides any evidence to support his conspiracy theory. Ardis, for example, recites some of the claims that he’s made before about remdesivir, falsely claiming that it’s a “toxic, deadly drug” being used to purposely poison people. As if to prove this point, the video misleadingly shows a table from a paper in which 53% of patients treated with remdesivir died. But that comes from a trial of patients with Ebola virus disease and does not show that those patients died because of the drug. In fact, contrary to his claim that research papers show remdesivir is dangerous, studies have found that serious adverse events aren’t more common in COVID-19 patients treated with the drug compared with those who aren’t. No drug is 100% safe, but there is zero evidence that remdesivir is being used by physicians across the country to kill patients. Using maneuvers like that throughout the video, Ardis presents a wide-ranging conspiracy theory, in which he suggests that the pandemic has actually been a plot carried out by the Catholic Church and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to poison people with snake venom. “I am convinced that COVID-19 is not a respiratory virus of any kind,” he says. “It is actually venom poisoning, and they’re using, I believe, synthesized peptides and proteins from venoms of snakes, and they’re administering them and targeting them to certain people.” But, as we’ve explained before, s cientists in China first isolated the virus that causes COVID-19 on Jan. 7, 2020. Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. then isolated the virus later that month, from a patient who was diagnosed with the disease in Washington state. And scientists in other countries have also isolated the virus. The World Health Organization announced the official name of the virus — SARS-CoV-2 — on Feb. 11, 2020. So, it’s been clear for a long time that COVID-19 is caused by a virus. (And snake venom isn’t made of viruses. It’s a secretion that contains toxins.) Also, several competing pharmaceutical companies have developed vaccines that effectively prevent severe illness from the virus. Ardis cast doubt on the vaccines, though, by alluding to a conspiracy theory that claims the vaccines have made people magnetic. We debunked that theory when it first became popular, as the vaccines began rolling out widely in the U.S. in the spring of 2021. But the linchpin for his whole nonsensical theory is a 2017 episode of a network TV drama called “The Blacklist .” After laying the groundwork for about half-an-hour, the video shows a clip from an episode of NBC’s “The Blacklist” in which the main character is poisoned with snake venom in a beverage. “When I saw this, I knew,” Ardis says of watching the show , which originally aired in 2017 — almost three years before the outbreak of COVID-19. It’ s now available on Netflix . “I knew I was right, I knew I was supposed to see that, because it was confirmation to me that other people knew this was planned all along, which, we’ve known this was a plan.” One of the well-worn conspiracy theories that Ardis relies on here claims that the pandemic was planned in advance by nefarious actors — one of the most viral versions of this theory was presented in a pair of videos from 2020 called “Plandemic,” each of which we’ve written about . Ardis goes on to explain that, when he saw the main character in the show being poisoned through a beverage, “I realized something — I realized how they’ve been spreading this.” (Read our SciCheck item “ How is COVID-19 transmitted? ” for the facts about transmission.) The video then shows a hand placing a rapid COVID-19 test under tap water. As sinister music plays in the background, text reading “WATCH THE WATER” appears on screen. The name of the video is also, “Watch The Water,” which is an apparent reference to another conspiracy theory, QAnon, which has flourished during the pandemic . That phrase was used in a February 2018 post from “Q,” the pseudonym used by the person or people who post cryptic messages on internet message boards that are the basis for the QAnon conspiracy theory. That phrase has been used to support a number of false claims over the years, including that ballots in the 2020 election had secret watermarks and that “Q” had predicted a back-up of container ships in the Suez Canal in 2021. Here, the phrase is used to buttress Ardis’ theory that public drinking water is being poisoned with snake venom. “They are using krait venom and cobra venom, calling it COVID-19, you’re drinking it, it’s getting into your brain stem, and it’s paralyzing your diaphragm’s ability to breath,” Ardis says. He later explains that “the CDC is in on it” and suggests that the plot may have ultimately come from “the Catholic Church or whoever.” As he explains that he believes that the CDC is involved because it monitors wastewater in some locations, Ardis says, it’s “Just like in the show Blacklist.” But it’s not. That show wasn’t meant to suggest that there was a plot to poison swaths of the public with snake venom under the guise of a viral pandemic, Blacklist creator Jon Bokenkamp told us in a phone interview. That episode was not written to foreshadow the pandemic, he said. Rather, it was meant to show an unconventional criminal using an unusual method to poison someone as entertainment. The snake venom “was a great way to have a far-fetched, but slightly grounded version of bad guy,” Bokenkamp said. “It was a story.” He noted that the show is in its ninth season and, like any long-running show, it has sometimes coincidentally reflected things to come, like one episode from 2015 called “The Troll Farmer,” in which a disinformation campaign manipulated real-world events. So, there’s no reason to believe that this fictional show has somehow revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is actually a plot to poison people with snake venom. The underlying notion that COVID-19 is caused by snake venom is simply untrue. Scientists across the globe have been studying SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that causes COVID-19 — for more than two years, and there is no question that the disease is caused by a virus.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Study Largely Confirms Known, Rare COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects\". [/INST] COVID-19 vaccines — like all vaccines and other medical products — come with side effects, including serious side effects in rare cases. The vaccines were rolled out to protect people from a novel virus that has killed millions of people globally and would likely have killed millions more without the arrival of the vaccines. There is a broad consensus from experts and governmental health agencies that the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. Researchers have scrutinized the COVID-19 vaccines’ safety and continue to do so. A study published Feb. 12 in the journal Vaccine reported on an international group of more than 99 million people who received COVID-19 vaccines, primarily finding links to known rare side effects. The study largely focused on the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which have been widely given in the U.S., as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was never authorized in the U.S. “What we take away, is that the Covid-19 vaccination campaigns have been very effective in preventing severe disease,” study co-author Anders Hviid , head of the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark, told us in an email. “The few serious side effects that we have observed in this and other studies have been rare.” Many popular posts on social media have shared results from the study, some lacking the context that the identified health problems are rare , that most aren’t new and that the vaccines have proven benefits. Various posts made unfounded claims, stating or implying that people should not have received the vaccines , that the risks outweigh the benefits or that the risk of the rare side effects is greater than was reported in the study. “Hundreds of millions of people were used as lab rats and now the truth that WE ALL ALREADY KNEW can no longer be denied,” said one popular post , referring to the vaccines as “experimental” and “UNTESTED.” The post shared a screenshot of the headline of a New York Post article about the new study, which read, “COVID vaccines linked to slight increases in heart, brain, blood disorders: study.” “This thing was forced on people who faced almost no risk from Covid,” said another widely read post . “It is completely unacceptable.” The post shared statistics from the paper without making it clear that serious health problems after vaccination were rare and that risk varied by vaccine type and dose. The Vaccine study confirmed that the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are linked in rare cases to myocarditis and pericarditis, conditions involving inflammation of the heart muscle and lining. The rate of myocarditis was most elevated after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. Myocarditis risk — which is greatest in men in their late teens and early twenties — was identified via vaccine safety monitoring and first reported in 2021. Based on the current evidence, the CDC says, the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk of these conditions, which improve for most people after medical treatment and rest. The study confirmed neurological and blood clotting conditions associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. In the U.S., these problems were linked to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, contributing to this vaccine no longer being recommended or available. The study also identified a new possible safety signal indicating a potential link between the first dose of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines and rare neurological conditions. This included an association between the first doses of the vaccines and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM, an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Hviid emphasized that the researchers only saw these neurological events after first doses of the two vaccines. “We did not see these signals following further doses of these two Covid-19 vaccines, nor did we see them after any dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which has been more widely used,” he said. “We are also talking about very rare events,” Hviid continued. “As an example, the association between the first dose of Moderna and acute inflammation of the brain and spine would, if causal, correspond to 1 case per 1.75 million vaccinated. It is only due to the sheer scale of our study, that we have been able to identify this minute potential risk.” The Vaccine study drew on national or regional health records from eight countries with institutions participating in the Global Vaccine Data Network , an international group that studies vaccine safety. The researchers analyzed health outcomes after around 184 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 36 million doses of the Moderna vaccine and 23 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The researchers focused on 13 health problems that either had a known association with vaccination or for which there was some rationale to investigate whether there was an association. To determine whether the health problems were associated with vaccination, they compared the expected rates of the health problems — or the number of health events that should occur based on background rates in the regions studied — with the number of events they observed in the 42 days after vaccination. “This study confirms the primary already detected and validated side effects established by previous literature,” Jeffrey S. Morris , director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told us via email, referring to the rare heart conditions associated with the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, as well as the rare conditions associated with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Morris said that findings on ADEM — the rare autoimmune neurological condition linked to first doses of the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines — “might be a new safety signal.” ADEM involves inflammation to the brain and spinal cord, arising most often in children following an infectious illness. It has a sudden onset and typically eventually improves, with a full recovery in many, although not all, cases. After the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, researchers observed seven ADEM cases, when they expected two. As we’ve said, Hviid calculated the rate of this side effect — if ultimately shown to be related to vaccination — to be 1 in 1.75 million following the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. The data show “this was indeed an EXTREMELY rare adverse event,” Morris said, referring to ADEM. “It is understandable at this incidence rate why it may not have been detected before now, and why a study with 99 million participants like this is important to find even the most rare serious adverse events that are potential minority harm risks of these vaccines.” The authors of the study wrote that more research is needed into ADEM following COVID-19 vaccination, saying that “the number of cases of this rare event were small and the confidence interval wide, so results should be interpreted with caution and confirmed in future studies.” The authors also wrote that neurological events have been found to occur at a much higher rate after COVID-19 than after COVID-19 vaccination. The study means that “early warning systems are solid,” said Marc Veldhoen , an immunologist at the Instituto de Medicina Molecular João Lobo Antunes in Portugal, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “To avoid any adverse reaction is not possible, but, identifying those at higher risk may be possible.” Identifying those at greater risk of side effects can help guide decisions on which vaccines to recommend and what problems doctors should watch for in their patients."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Misrepresents Lasting Effects of Nuclear Bombs Dropped on Japan During World War II\". [/INST] The United States dropped an atomic bomb — a nuclear weapon that releases explosive energy by splitting the nuclei of atoms — on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945. The uranium bomb, with a force of 13 kilotons, killed an estimated 237,000 people in the explosion or through the subsequent effects, including radiation sickness and cancer. The U.S. dropped leaflets in parts of Japan warning of the weapon’s destructive power and asking citizens to “petition the Emperor to end the war.” On Aug. 9, a plutonium bomb with an explosive force of 21 kilotons was dropped on Nagasaki. More than 73,000 people died in that bombing and its aftermath. The following day, Japan told the U.S. it would surrender . The recently released film “Oppenheimer” focuses on the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the development of those first nuclear bombs. Now, in the wake of the movie’s release and the anniversary of the bombings, a video posted Aug. 2 on Facebook makes the false claim that “Hiroshima and Nagasaki were never Nuked.” The video misleadingly suggests that nuclear weapons could not have been used in Japan. The narration says, in part “These bombs … were plutonium- and uranium-based nuclear weapons. Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,110 years and Uranium-235 has a half-life of 703 million years, in theory, making both Hiroshima and Nagasaki uninhabitable for thousands of years. … Are these two cities thriving in a nuclear wasteland? Or, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were never Nuked.” The radiological half-life refers to “the time required for half the atoms of a particular radioisotope to decay into another isotope,” as explained by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But the half-life of the isotopes Plutonium-239 and Uranium-235 do not determine the length of time the cities would retain dangerous levels of radiation. The webpage of the city of Hiroshima explains: “The radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki today is on a par with the extremely low levels of background radiation (natural radioactivity) present anywhere on Earth. It has no effect on human bodies. …” “The initial radiation emitted at the moment of detonation [of the bombs] inflicted great damage to human bodies. Most of those exposed to direct radiation within a one-kilometer radius died. Residual radiation was emitted later. Roughly 80% of all residual radiation was emitted within 24 hours. Research has indicated that 24 hours after the bombing the quantity of residual radiation a person would receive at the hypocenter would be 1/1000th of the quantity received immediately following the explosion. A week later, it would be 1/1,000,000th. Thus, residual radiation declined rapidly.” In addition, the Radiation Effects Research Foundation , a U.S.-Japan cooperative research institute, explains that the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki “exploded at altitudes of 600 meters and 503 meters, respectively, then formed huge fireballs that rose with ascending air currents. About 10% of the nuclear material in the bombs underwent fission ; the remaining 90% rose into the stratosphere with the fireball. … [M]ost of the remaining uranium and plutonium was widely dispersed in the atmosphere.” This is not to say that the radioactive material had no lasting effect on the people living in those cities. In addition to the deaths from the direct force and heat of the explosions or acute radiation exposure, the bombs’ radiation continued to cause health effects years later. The K=1 Project at Columbia University reported that an increase in leukemia occurred two years after the bombing and peaked four to six years later. Other cancers began to appear 10 years after the bombings. Scientists are still tracking the health effects of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. The video on Facebook doesn’t offer any explanation for what caused the magnitude of the deaths and devastation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki."

[/INST]  Stoney’s flier says, \"Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools.\" The Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference. Mayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berry’s support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the board’s proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan. Stoney’s statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didn’t. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didn’t have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/23f24b7a-2d34-4c7d-9f00-81e65e12263b. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Airs False, Misleading Claims About Face Masks\". [/INST] A Missouri-based chiropractor — who has been previously warned by federal officials to stop spreading misleading content regarding unproven COVID-19 treatments — is now wrongly telling Facebook users that face masks have been proven “unsafe” and “ineffective.” In a Feb. 11 video live-streamed on Facebook and viewed more than 70,000 times, Eric Nepute rattles off a list of 20 arguments against wearing face masks — claiming, for example, that they cause cavities and “facial deformities” and increase the chances of contracting the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But many of Nepute’s claims are false, misleading or unsupported. And a central takeaway — that masks are “ineffective” — is rebuffed by recent evidence to the contrary.  Two doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently summarized the growing evidence that masks can help to control community spread of the virus. In a piece for the Journal of the American Medical Association , they wrote: “ Compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers’ exposure to infection.” Rather than cite credible research on masks, Nepute largely adapted his claims from a January post on the website of the Canada-based Centre for Research on Globalization. That website has pushed conspiracy theories about the 9/11 terrorist attacks and other topics ; a recent State Department report said the website “has been a steady source of anti-U.S. and anti-Western disinformation and propaganda ever since” its 2001 debut. For his part, Nepute has spread unsound advice before, drawing the scrutiny of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC in May sent a letter warning Nepute that he was unlawfully advertising products and services — including chiropractic care and intravenous vitamin therapy — to treat or prevent COVID-19. The letter advised him to “immediately cease making all such claims.” Update, April 28: The FTC and Department of Justice announced on April 15 that the government had charged Nepute with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act “by deceptively marketing products containing vitamin D and zinc as scientifically proven to treat or prevent COVID-19.” It was the first civil complaint alleging violations of the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, which was part of an appropriations package signed into law in December. Throughout Nepute’s 24-minute video about masks, he repeatedly urges viewers to visit his website for vitamins while presenting the faulty claims about face masks — and later, COVID-19 vaccines and more. Here, we’ll fact-check a few of the claims in the video.  Nepute begins: “Reason no. 1 — this is wild right here. Cavities. I didn’t even know this was a thing until I started digging into it about a week or so ago. New York dentists are reporting that half their patients are suffering from decaying teeth at a higher rate in 2021 and 2020 than they had been before, due to — and this is Dr. Rob Raimondi — he told Fox News that just a week ago, that people are getting cavities from wearing a mask.” The underlying story from the Centre for Research on Globalization that is being used by Nepute refers to an interview that Raimondi, a dentist in New York, did with the New York Post in August, which was republished on the Fox News website. Raimondi told the Post that his practice was seeing people with gum inflammation and “cavities in people who have never had them before … about 50% of our patients are being impacted by this.” But the American Dental Association told us in a statement that “[t]o date, we have seen no evidence of an increase in cavities in the last year, or that wearing a mask affects your risk of cavities.” Dr. Patricia Corby , associate dean of translational research in the department of oral medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, similarly told us in an email that “ there is no rationale why wearing a mask would increase decay or periodontal disease. Also, no research has been done to prove otherwise.” What Raimondi and a colleague told the Post , more specifically, was that wearing a mask can increase mouth dryness, since people may breathe more through their mouth when wearing a mask, which can lead to bacteria building up. But they didn’t advocate against wearing masks. Raimondi i n a subsequent Instagram post about the interview said , “ We absolutely support mask wearing.” He recommended some ideas for avoiding dry mouth. The American Dental Association likewise told us that “excessive breathing through your mouth, whether you are wearing a mask or not, may increase development of dry mouth, which increases the risk of cavities. Saliva helps to keep the mouth moist and remineralize tooth enamel which helps fight decay. Even when wearing a mask, it is best to breathe through your nose. Another good way to decrease the risk of cavities is to drink fluoridated water. This can help to avoid dry mouth as the fluoride in the water will help prevent tooth decay.” Corby said COVID-19 could have affected individuals’ dental and oral health in another way: The pandemic prompted dental clinics around the world to shut down — and some practices to close completely. Even when some could reopen, she said, the pace was slow and some patients were hesitant to visit the dentist. “No. 2: Facial deformities. Masking children triggers mouth breathing, which has been shown to cause narrowing of the face, narrowing of the mouth, high vaults in the palate, dental malocclusions — and the list goes on and on,” Nepute tells his viewers. “This is according to the Journal of General Dentistry. They say you shouldn’t wear one.” He’s referring to the Academy of General Dentistry’s journal, General Dentistry , which did not say not to wear a mask. The report being referenced didn’t evaluate masks at all. Instead, the 2009 report looked at the implications of mouth breathing in children. Dr. Callan White , a dentist and national spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry, told us by phone that the video’s claim requires “several jumps.” There is no scientific evidence showing that children resort to exclusively breathing through their mouth while wearing a mask, he said, and that they do so for long enough to mirror children who experience chronic mouth breathing. “Children who suffer from these conditions aren’t able to breathe through their nose at all, or very little, at all times. This condition creates the most harmful effects at night while the child is sleeping,” he told us in an email. “There is a significant difference in frequency and duration of the habit” of mouth breathing due to wearing a mask. “With this said, remind children to breathe through their nose while wearing a mask, make sure the mask properly fits the child, take mask breaks when possible, and clean/disinfect cloth masks frequently (discard disposable masks as directed by manufacturer),” he added. Nepute also misleadingly claims that face masks are associated with an “increased risk of COVID-19.” “What, wait a minute, I thought I was wearing a mask to stop the spread of COVID-19?” he says. “Just like when they told me that I’m getting a vaccine to stop the spread, that doesn’t do it either.” (We’ll address his factual distortions about vaccines later in this story.) He then cites “public health officials of Ontario” to claim that “mask use by the general public could be associated with the … theoretical elevated (risk) of COVID-19.” That’s a reference to a September document issued by Public Health Ontario that described what the agency knew about the use of masks to control the spread of the coronavirus — including the benefits, which Nepute fails to mention. Instead, Nepute homes in on only one part of the document, which says: “Mask use by the general public could be associated with a theoretical elevated risk of COVID-19 through decreased physical distancing and self-contamination.” But those, again, are theoretical risks — and ones that can be mitigated if other steps are taken while wearing masks. The first theoretical risk is that people wearing masks may not maintain physical distancing. But that’s why health officials have continued to advise that masks should be worn in addition to, not in place of, distancing. And the second theoretical risk Nepute is citing, of self-contamination, “ refers to evidence that shows the frequency of face-touching behaviour in general,” Public Health Ontario told us in an email. The agency said “the point about the ‘theoretical elevated risk’ is taken out of context.” “If the outside of a mask is contaminated, there would be a theoretical risk that touching the mask then touching your face could result in exposure to virus … the mitigation for that is frequent hand hygiene,” PHO told us. “PHO continues to monitor and review the emerging evidence on non-medical masks and COVID-19.” The agency further noted that the same document being cited also said on its first page that “ the evidence shows that public mask-wearing is likely beneficial as source control and mandatory public mask policies have been associated with a decrease in new COVID-19 cases compared to regions without such policies.” “Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise,” Nepute says. “We’ve seen a ton of that in our practices. We’ve seen so much respiratory bacterial infections it’s not even funny, especially among children.” He adds: “In Oklahoma press conference, Dr. James Meehan indeed testified, reporting coming from all of his colleagues are showing, across the world, increase in bacterial pneumonia.” Nepute is referencing an ophthalmologist who was speaking out against a mask mandate in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in August. Meehan claimed (at 4:40) that “reports coming from my colleagues all over the world are suggesting that bacterial pneumonias are on the rise.” He went to say he believed “untrained members of the public are wearing medical masks repeatedly, in a non-sterile fashion.” It’s true that experts do not recommend that medical masks that are meant to be worn once be reused. But we found no evidence to suggest that cases of bacterial pneumonia are on the rise — or that masks are causing such a trend. And experts have debunked different iterations of the same claim before. For example, Dr. Catharine Paules , an assistant professor at Penn State who specializes in infectious diseases, has said “there is no data” to support the claim that masks trap in bacteria and fungus and make people more susceptible to bacterial or fungal pneumonia. And our fact-checking colleagues at Reuters debunked a viral falsehood in September that mask-wearers were “arriving in ICU with antibiotic resistant strains of pneumonia from breathing in the pathogenic organisms they were meant to exhale.” Nepute goes on to wrongly claim that “oh, by the way, that’s the No. 1 thing that killed everybody during the Spanish Flu of 1918. Not the virus, but the bacterial infections. These masks are causing this.” That’s inaccurate, too. In 2008, researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — including the institute’s director, Dr. Anthony Fauci — published a study that found that most deaths from the 1918 flu pandemic likely resulted from secondary bacterial pneumonia after contracting the flu. “The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs,” the National Institutes of Health said in a release explaining the study. So to suggest the flu wasn’t involved in those deaths is wrong. Furthermore, that study made no mention of masks."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Spin Falsehood Out of Denmark’s COVID-19 Booster Drive\". [/INST] Booster shots formulated to better protect against severe illness from the currently circulating variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 are now available . Which means that bogus claims from those who spread vaccine misinformation are making the rounds, too. Conservative talk show host Clay Travis, for example, said in a video clip posted on Facebook: “Denmark is banning the COVID shot for anyone under the age of 50 because it is not safe.” Like others who have made similar claims, Travis cited a suggestive Sept. 14 Substack post from Alex Berenson, a former New York Times reporter who has sown doubt about the vaccines during the pandemic. But it’s not true that Denmark is “banning” the boosters for those under 50 due to safety concerns. Rather, the Danish Health Authority is focusing its fall vaccination drive on those who are most vulnerable to severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19 — which means those who are over 60. But the Danish health system is offering the boosters to everyone 50 and older as a precaution, as it has explained in the publicly available report on the reasoning and planned implementation of the program. The current Danish vaccination program — announced on Sept. 13 — is aimed at 2.5 million people, Tina Gustavsen, a spokeswoman for the Danish Health Authority, told us in an email. The total population of Denmark is 5.9 million, according to the World Bank . Referring to the plan to give booster shots to roughly half the country, she said, “It stands to reason that any health authority on the planet would only do this when they are convinced that the vaccines are safe.” In addition to anyone 50 and older, the booster shots will be given to those under 50 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk for severe illness, those who work in health care or eldercare, relatives of those who are at high risk and pregnant women. “The aim of the vaccination programme against covid-19 this autumn is to get us well through the winter by protecting people who are at the highest risk of becoming severely ill and by avoiding that the Danish healthcare system, especially the hospitals, are overburdened,” the Danish Health Authority explained in an English-language post on its website. Further, Gustavsen told us by email, “Data also show that the population under the age of 50 is expected to have significant immunity, both as a result of previous infection and previous vaccination. On this basis, and due to the fact that very few persons under the age of 50 are at risk of running a serious course of covid-19 disease, the Danish Health Authority does not currently plan on recommending vaccination to persons under the age of 18 as a group. Children and young people who are at increased risk of a serious course of covid-19 will continue to have the option of vaccination after individual assessment.” We asked if those under 50 who don’t fit the increased risk criteria could get a booster if they wanted. Gustavsen said, “In Denmark, the vaccination strategy against covid-19 in the fall/winter 2022/23 is to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death from covid-19 – not to prevent infections.” She also noted that primary vaccination continues to be available for those under 50. As of Sept. 13 , about 82% of Denmark’s population was fully vaccinated, compared to about 68% in the U.S. “We have achieved very high population immunity in Denmark,” the Danish Health Authority wrote in an explainer about the new booster drive. “This is due both to the high adherence to the vaccination programme and to many people previously having been infected with covid-19. … We expect that a large part of the population will become infected with covid-19 during the autumn, and we therefore want to vaccinate those having the highest risk so that they are protected from severe illness if they become infected.” So, the claim that Denmark has banned those under 50 from getting vaccinated against COVID-19 due to safety concerns is false. The country has a high rate of adherence to vaccination and is focusing its current booster drive on those who are most vulnerable, which accounts for nearly half the population.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent WHO Term ‘Disease X’ for Possible Future Illness\". [/INST] Disease X is the term the World Health Organization uses as a placeholder to represent an as-yet unknown new illness. That’s like the term X factor , meaning an essential quality that is hard to define, or the use of X in mathematics, where the letter represents an unknown variable. But online, conspiracy theorists and misinformation peddlers have twisted the term Disease X into something that is supposedly part of a sinister plot to wreak havoc on the world. For example, Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind InfoWars, claimed in a post on X , the platform formerly known as Twitter, that there is a “Globalist Plan to Launch #DiseaseX to Install World Government.” And Donald Trump Jr. referred to a Jan. 17 panel held at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, when he wrote on Instagram , “I don’t trust the WEF clowns as far as I could throw them… They’re already talking about Disease X. Be prepared for whatever they throw you by checking out The Wellness Company, one of my triggered podcast’s newest sponsors!!!!” Trump’s post asks “Why are they preparing for a hypothetical disease?” and encourages followers to purchase the Wellness Company’s “emergency medical kit.” The kit includes ivermectin and sells for $299.99 from his podcast sponsor , which we’ve written about before. But posts that suggest or claim Disease X will be intentionally released in pursuit of world domination are unfounded. As we said, the term is a placeholder that public health officials use to refer to potential future diseases, and the WEF panel Trump Jr. mentioned was focused on how governments and health systems can prepare for the next pandemic. During the panel discussion in Davos earlier this month, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledged the misinformation circulating on social media about Disease X. He explained, “we annually list the emerging diseases and MERS could be one, Zika, Ebola — those we know — but then we said, there are things that are unknown, that may happen and anything happening is a matter of when, not if, so we need to have a placeholder for that, for the diseases we don’t know that may come. And that was when we gave the name, ‘Disease X.’ So, ‘Disease X’ is a placeholder for unknown diseases.” The WHO began using the term in 2018, Tedros said. The organization’s February 2018 “ annual review of diseases prioritized under the Research and Development Blueprint ” listed eight types of priority diseases. The list included “Disease X,” which the document described as representing “the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease, and so the R&D Blueprint explicitly seeks to enable cross-cutting R&D preparedness that is also relevant for an unknown ‘Disease X’ as far as possible.” So the term is nothing new. It has been used for six years. Tedros acknowledged that discussing the possible emergence of a deadly, new pathogen “may create panic.” But, he said, “It’s better actually to anticipate something that may happen — because it has happened in our history many times — and prepare for it. We shouldn’t face things unprepared. We can prepare for some unknown things as well. Because there are basic things you can do.” During the panel discussion, some of the suggestions for ways to prepare for the next Disease X were smoothing supply chains for vaccines, treatments and medical equipment; reinforcing epidemiological centers so there is better surveillance; and building health care systems that can expand when the need arises. “Whatever the disease is, you should prepare for it,” Tedros said. “You don’t need to know the disease — there are common factors.”"

Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia posted a Fourth of July message on social media. Her official Twitter account shared an image of a stone slab with claims about the signers of the Declaration of Independence beneath text that said : “Happy Independence Day! Let us have honor like these men.” But a different Independence Day message that’s been made to look as though it came from Greene’s account has been circulating on social media. The phony tweet , which appropriates Greene’s Twitter profile photo, says: “246 years ago Jesus Christ performed his miracle of making a single days worth of bullets last 8 days, allowing The Continental Army (Americans Woot!) to defeat the Socialist Mexicans and the Liberal British (who were also Muslim). That’s why I give thanks this 4th of July.” The post alludes to the story of Hanukkah , in which oil that was supposed to last for only one night miraculously lasted for eight nights, and Thanksgiving , a holiday on which people traditionally give thanks. The tweet doesn’t appear anywhere on Greene’s official Twitter feed, and it’s not in the database of politicians’ deleted tweets that’s maintained by ProPublica.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Data Comparing Vaccinated vs. Unvaccinated Continue to Be Available, Contrary to Viral Posts\". [/INST] The CDC monitors rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status and age group, and publishes data and interactive tables on its website monthly, where anyone can download them. According to the CDC website, COVID-19 case and death information is collected from jurisdictions that can link their case surveillance data to immunization data, and identify the vaccination status of people who test positive. The data on COVID-19 hospitalizations are collected by COVID-NET , a surveillance system that collects data on hospitalizations of children and adults with a confirmed infection through a network of over 250 hospitals in 14 states. The data are used by the agency to better understand how well the vaccines are working against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. According to this data, for example , unvaccinated people over 5 years old were 2.4 times more likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 in January . And in February , unvaccinated adults ages 18 and older were 5 times more likely to have a COVID-19-associated hospitalization than fully vaccinated adults. The COVID-19 case and death rate data by vaccination status were last updated on March 17, and cover April 2021 to Feb. 19 for cases and through Jan. 29 for deaths. The data for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations by vaccination status from January 2021 to Feb. 26 were posted on March 24, and then updated on March 31. The agency has not communicated any intention to discontinue these publications. “The next update for rates of cases and deaths by vaccination status will be mid-April and include case data through mid-March and death data through late February. Hospitalization rates by vaccination status will be updated end of April and will include data through the end of March. These time frames allow the subject matter experts to process and complete a thorough analysis of the data,” CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed told us in an email. Yet, a March 26 tweet , which went viral, claimed that the “CDC is no longer releasing data comparing vaccinated vs unvaccinated deaths & hospitalizations.” Even though the tweet was later deleted by its author, it is still being shared on other platforms . Scott Morefield , the author of the tweet and a weekly columnist for the conservative website Townhall, told us he wrote it after seeing Dr. Aaron Kheriaty on the March 26 episode of Fox News’ “ Unfiltered with Dan Bongino . ” On the show, Kheriaty, who is against COVID-19 vaccine mandates and was recently fired from the University of California, Irvine for refusing to get vaccinated, questioned the effectiveness of vaccines that have proved to be effective in trials and in the real world. He said “we don’t know” how the COVID-19 vaccines are working in the U.S. “because the CDC is no longer releasing their data comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated cases, hospitalizations and deaths.” A Facebook post with the video, uploaded to the show’s page on March 30, has more than 37,000 views. “A spokesperson for the CDC told the New York Times a few weeks ago, the reason that they are not releasing the data anymore, that we’ve seen throughout the pandemic, is they have worries it’s not ready for prime time because it might increase vaccine hesitancy. So what’s going on here? Why are these basic metrics being withheld from the American people?” Kheriaty said during the show. Kheriaty was making reference to a New York Times story published on Feb. 20 that reported the CDC had “withheld critical data” on boosters, hospitalizations and wastewater analyses. In particular, the story said the CDC left out data on the effectiveness of boosters in people ages 18 to 49. A previous New York Times story had reported that, when releasing data on COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths among people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated, with or without boosters, on Feb. 3, the CDC had not included “hospitalization numbers for adults 18 through 49 perhaps because the numbers were too small.” The CDC published that data on Feb. 17."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Ventilators Save Lives, Did Not Cause ‘Nearly All’ COVID-19 Deaths\". [/INST] COVID-19 can cause lung damage and respiratory failure. In patients who are unable to breathe well enough to supply oxygen to their bodies, mechanical ventilators can be lifesaving and give them time to recover. Ventilators help people breathe by pushing air into their lungs via a tube inserted down their windpipe. Yet, social media posts have shared an article from the People’s Voice with a false headline: “Official Report: Ventilators Killed Nearly ALL COVID Patients.” The People’s Voice, formerly News Punch, frequently publishes articles with false and inflammatory headlines . The posts misrepresent the conclusions of a study published in April in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The idea that ventilators — and not COVID-19 — killed nearly all COVID-19 patients is “quite wrong,” study co-author Dr. Benjamin Singer , a pulmonary and critical care physician at Northwestern Medicine, told us. Rep. Thomas Massie , a Republican from Kentucky, also misrepresented the conclusions of the study, tweeting , “How many COVID patients died due to the use of ventilators? A recent examination of the data suggests quite a few.” The idea that ventilators are dangerous, and not COVID-19, is a misinterpretation of his data, Singer said. “It’s not the ventilator that was the cause of death,” he said. “The ventilator was very much life support for these patients. It was ultimately COVID-19” that caused the deaths. Singer’s study looked at 585 people put on ventilators due to respiratory failure between 2018 and 2022 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. These people primarily had COVID-19 or some other infectious disease, such as another viral or bacterial illness. Around half of these very sick patients who required mechanical ventilation — people who likely would have died without the intervention — went on to survive their illness. The survival rate was similar whether they had COVID-19 or another disease and was consistent with the survival rate for COVID-19 patients on ventilators found in another, larger study . Singer’s study explored the degree to which a known ventilator-related complication called ventilator-associated pneumonia contributes to death, finding that the complication is more common in people with COVID-19 and, when unresolved, is linked to death. VAP is usually treated with antibiotics. People with COVID-19 likely have an elevated risk of VAP because they stay on ventilators for longer-than-average periods. COVID-19 also affects the immune system and damages the surface of the lungs in unique ways, Singer said, which could potentially make the lungs more susceptible to secondary infections. VAP contributes to death in some COVID-19 and other infectious disease patients, explained Dr. Mark Metersky , a pulmonary and critical care physician and professor at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. However, virtually all of these patients would have died if they had not been put on a ventilator, he said. “It’s not that the ventilator killed them, the ones who died. It’s that the ventilator failed to save them.” A related claim in a popular post — that medical professionals put patients on ventilators due to financial incentives — is also unsupported by evidence, as we and other fact-checkers previously explained. It’s standard for hospitals to get more money for patients, such as those on ventilators, who require more care. VAP typically occurs as a form of secondary pneumonia, which means it shows up in patients who already have another pneumonia diagnosis, such as pneumonia resulting from COVID-19, the flu or a bacterial infection. People are diagnosed with pneumonia when their lungs become swollen with fluid from a respiratory infection. VAP typically arises from bacteria introduced to the lungs via the patient’s breathing tube. Singer’s new paper finds that once very sick COVID-19 patients are on ventilators, they are at greater risk of VAP compared with other similarly ill pneumonia patients, he said. Further, the paper found that “whether that ventilator-associated pneumonia was cured or not was a major determinant of whether patients went on to live or die in the ICU,” he said. However, just being diagnosed with VAP was not associated with a higher risk of death. Based on these conclusions, the People’s Voice article makes a false claim, which was shared widely: “Nearly all COVID-19 patients who died in hospital during the early phase of the pandemic were killed as a direct result of being put on a ventilator, a disturbing new report has concluded.” First, many hospitalized COVID-19 patients have died who never went on ventilators. And Singer’s study was not limited to “the early phase of the pandemic” but rather went through March 2022. As we’ve said, this line of thinking is also misleading because it does not make it clear that the patients on ventilators would have typically died without them. It is also untrue that Singer’s study showed that ventilator-related complications killed “nearly all” ventilated patients who died. The People’s Voice article explains its reasoning by saying that “most patients” put on ventilators because of COVID-19 developed VAP. “So while COVID-19 may have put these patients in the hospital, it was actually a secondary infection brought on by the use of a mechanical ventilator that caused their deaths,” the article says. In reality, 57% of COVID-19 patients on ventilators in the study developed VAP and a quarter of other ventilated pneumonia patients did. Around half of all patients with VAP died, which was “not significantly different” from the death rate in patients on ventilators who didn’t have VAP, according to the study. Singer and his colleagues did find that patients whose VAP was not successfully treated were more likely to die than patients whose VAP resolved, indicating a connection between VAP and poor outcomes. The study was not randomized, and the researchers write that they cannot definitively determine that unresolved VAP — and not some other factor associated with it — leads to poor outcomes. Metersky was skeptical that VAP is that much of a contributor to mortality, pointing to other studies that show a lower rate of VAP in pneumonia patients than was found in Singer’s study. “Yes, some patients who are put on a ventilator will develop a fatal complication,” Metersky said. “Probably 1 in 100” patients put on a ventilator develop fatal VAP, he said, based on data from before the pandemic . Since about twice as many COVID-19 patients develop VAP compared with other pneumonia patients on ventilators, he said that would indicate that around 2% of people with COVID-19 who go on a ventilator die of VAP. “But there are other complications,” Metersky said. These can include damage to the lungs from high oxygen and the air pressure from the ventilator or side effects from drugs used to sedate people on ventilators, for instance. “That’s why we don’t put a patient on a ventilator unless they absolutely need it,” he said. Regardless, “it’s ridiculous to go from that study to say that the ventilators are killing all these people,” Metersky said, referring to the claim that nearly all COVID-19 deaths were caused by ventilators. Other false claims, reviewed previously by others , state that overuse of ventilators played a major role in the first wave of COVID-19 deaths. There were some suggestions very early in the pandemic that doctors should put COVID-19 patients on ventilators earlier than other pneumonia patients, Singer and Metersky both said, out of concern that respiratory failure might progress very quickly. This was soon followed by calls for caution in ventilating patients early, and these practices quickly stopped, Singer said. “The standard indications for initiation of mechanical ventilation are really the same as they always have been” for patients with pneumonia, he said, regardless of whether they have COVID-19. Multiple facts about the early ventilation recommendations are unclear. First, there was no standard definition of what experts meant when recommending “early” ventilation. Decisions on when patients require mechanical ventilation are based on the best judgment of their doctors as they monitor multiple indicators. Doctors want to be sure the ventilator is truly necessary — that the patient is headed toward death from respiratory failure without it. But they also don’t want to wait until the patient has organ damage from lack of oxygen. Second, it’s unclear how widespread early ventilation was. Singer mentioned that his own recent paper showed that Northwestern Medicine put patients with COVID-19 on ventilators after a similar amount of time in the ICU as other pneumonia patients. Others have pointed out that some doctors at the beginning of the pandemic took measures to avoid putting patients on ventilators due to shortages. Finally, it’s uncertain what impact early ventilation had on patients. The available research, recently reviewed in a blog post by epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wollongong in Australia, indicates that early versus later ventilation did not appreciably affect COVID-19 deaths. For instance, a review study that pooled and analyzed data from multiple studies found that going on a ventilator within a day of entering the ICU versus later had no impact on mortality. It is possible that people occasionally were put on ventilators who could have avoided them, but this is difficult to quantify. “There were probably a small number of patients who got put on a ventilator who ultimately might not have needed it,” Metersky said. “As we learned more about the disease, we learned to recognize that some patients may not need the ventilator. But it wasn’t this big conspiracy that we put everyone on the ventilator even though they could have gone home instead.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s articles providing accurate health information and correcting health misinformation are made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misinterpret CDC’s Provincetown COVID-19 Outbreak Report\". [/INST] A statistic from a CDC report about a COVID-19 outbreak in July is fueling false and misleading claims on social media about how well the Food and Drug Administration-authorized vaccines protect against the disease, which is caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical trials and studies of the vaccines under real-world conditions show that the immunizations are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death, even against the highly contagious delta variant — although they may work less well against infection and symptomatic disease with delta, as we’ve written . The delta variant now accounts for around 93% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to estimates from the CDC. The statistic in question comes from a paper published on July 30 in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which documents an outbreak of COVID-19 in Barnstable County, Massachusetts — elsewhere specified as Provincetown — that primarily occurred in vaccinated people, following large public events in the first half of the month. According to the report, of the 469 people included in the study who were in the area between July 3 and July 17 and tested positive for the coronavirus, 74% were fully vaccinated. A total of five people were hospitalized, four of them vaccinated, and there were no deaths. 90% of the subset of people who had sequencing performed on their samples were infected with the delta variant. Although not mentioned in the report, the outbreak overlapped with July Fourth weekend and “Bear Week,” Provincetown’s annual gathering of gay men; 85% of the identified infections were in males. In the summer, the town’s population swells to approximately 60,000 people . The report noted that at the time of diagnostic testing, the amount of virus appeared to be about the same in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, a finding that the CDC cited in its decision on July 27 to recommend masks for everyone, regardless of vaccination status, in indoor public spaces in areas with “substantial” or “high” transmission . But the 74% figure, while correct, can be misleading without the proper context, experts say, because as vaccination rates increase, it’s entirely expected for a larger and larger proportion of people who are infected to be vaccinated. It doesn’t mean the vaccines don’t work. “The problem is we are only looking at those who got infected, not at everyone in the area who was at risk of being infected,” Matthew Fox , an epidemiologist at Boston University School of Public Health, told us in an email. “Provincetown is an area with some of the highest vaccination rates in the country, so if the vaccine was not working, you’d expect the % vaccinated among the infected to be even higher than 75%, but we can’t say that for sure yet because we don’t know the denominators, we’d need more data. That said, all the carefully done studies to date that have included the denominators have shown the vaccine to be highly effective, even outside of the trials.” The paper says as much, writing that “data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak” and noting that as vaccination coverage increases, “vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases.” Numerous posts on Instagram and Facebook have nevertheless seized upon the 74% figure, often using screenshots of news headlines, without the proper context or with additional commentary to give the misleading impression that this is evidence that the vaccines don’t work, that vaccinated people are just as likely or even more likely to spread the virus as those who are unvaccinated, or that something nefarious is afoot . “We tried to tell y’all do not take their Experimental Vaccines,” reads one Instagram post , sharing a headline from CNBC. Another , sharing a similar headline, falsely implies that vaccinated people are more likely to spread the coronavirus than the unvaccinated. “REALITY CHECK!! The vaccinated ARE the super spreaders,” it says. “CDC study shows 74% of people infected in MA Covid outbreak were fully vaccinated debunking the ‘pandemic of the unvaccinated’ narrative,” reads an Instagram post, which is accompanied by a video of CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and President Joe Biden. Another claims Walensky admitted the vaccines “are now failing, and vaccinated people may now carry higher viral loads than unvaccinated people” and that “the people that got the Vaccine are the biggest carriers.” The CDC has used the MMWR report as justification for its change in mask guidance, interpreting the similar amounts of virus at the time of testing among the vaccinated and unvaccinated people in the outbreak as a sign that infected vaccinated people can transmit the virus. But as we’ll explain, that does not mean that the vaccinated and unvaccinated are equally likely to infect others. And while some vaccinated people have become infected with the coronavirus and have likely passed it on to others, the larger concern is still about unvaccinated people, who are far more likely to become infected, fall seriously ill and spread the virus. Posts and headlines that report that 74% of the COVID-19 cases in the Provincetown cluster were in vaccinated people are prone to misinterpretation because on the surface, that fact can seem surprising if the vaccines are supposed to work so well. “When a new vaccine is introduced into a population, when vaccination rates become very high, we can expect as many and sometimes more cases in the vaccinated population than the unvaccinated — even when the vaccine is doing its job and protecting people at a high rate — because the denominator of number of people vaccinated is so large,” Boston University’s Fox explained in a blog post . “Epidemiologists who study vaccinations are very aware of this phenomenon and yet, even though we expect it, it is hard to communicate the accurate and important message to people that this isn’t a sign of vaccine failure.” As we have written , because no vaccine is 100% effective, you do expect some cases in vaccinated people — and even with a very effective vaccine, the proportion of cases among the immunized can be high if much of the population has been vaccinated. To understand this, it’s helpful to consider an extreme example in which everyone in a given place has been immunized with a highly effective vaccine. “If you had a small outbreak in a town that was 100% vaccinated, 100% of the cases would be vaccinated,” William P. Hanage , an epidemiologist at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us, “but it wouldn’t mean the vaccines don’t work!”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Distort WHO Guidance on COVID-19 Tests\". [/INST] A recent memo from the World Health Organization designed for lab professionals became a major focus of misinformation — with unreliable websites and social media users claiming the agency had changed a testing protocol and admitted that COVID-19 cases have been wildly inflated. But neither of those claims is accurate. Instead, the Jan. 20 memo directed labs facilitating polymerase chain reaction, or PCR , tests to carefully follow manufacturer instructions for testing to prevent false positive and negative results . The distortions online also tied the purported change to U.S. politics. “An Hour After Joe Biden Is Sworn In, WHO Admits Their Testing Grossly Overstates Individuals Testing Positive for COVID,” read a headline from the Gateway Pundit, a website known for spreading misinformation. The story questioned the motives of public health agencies, asking, “how can these entities ever be trusted again?” The story was shared more than 8,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . Another website, Zero Hedge, which also has previously spread falsehoods, similarly told readers: “Right On Cue For Biden, WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives.” That story was shared on Facebook nearly 7,000 times.  Many posts also cited a viral tweet from David Samadi, a urologist and contributor to the conservative news channel Newsmax, whose work in a New York hospital was the subject of a federal investigation into fraudulent Medicare claims. That hospital reached a $12.3 million settlement in late 2019. In his tweet, which has since been deleted, Samadi said the guidance instructed labs “to reduce the cycle count in PCR tests to get a more accurate representation of COVID cases,” because “t he current cycle was much too high and resulting in any particle being declared a positive case.” One Facebook post sharing Samadi’s tweet claimed that the guidance proved “ they’ve been lying to you about case counts and mortality rate THE WHOLE TIME.” As we said, the WHO guidance implied no such admission. And the memo was an updated version of one issued a month earlier, on Dec. 14, so the idea that it was timed for Biden’s inauguration is wrong. As we’ve explained before , PCR tests work by scanning the RNA in a sample, such as a nose swab, and searching for the virus RNA. (See our SciCheck article “ The Facts on Coronavirus Testing .”) The PCR test analyzes samples by amplifying a segment of the virus’s genetic material in a series of cycles. A sample with a higher viral load, meaning more virus is present in the sample, will require fewer cycles to detect the novel coronavirus. Lower viral loads will be detected at higher cycles. There is no universal threshold setting or endpoint — “although 40-45 cycles is often used as the endpoint” of a PCR run — Ian MacKay , a virologist in Australia, told us in an email. The WHO’s Jan. 20 guidance said it was requesting that those conducting tests be sure to read manufacturer instructions “carefully to determine if manual adjustment of the PCR positivity threshold is recommended.” In a statement to FactCheck.org, the WHO said it had received 10 reports since early 2020 about some PCR tests providing both false positive and false negative results and that “[a] fter thorough investigation, WHO confirmed that the tests were not always being used appropriately and in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.” PCR tests are considered a gold standard for diagnostics among scientists, and while false negative and positive results are possible with any test, false positives from PCR tests are not thought to be a major or systemic issue — even positive results at high-cycle threshold values — experts say. For example, MacKay has observed that, looking at COVID-19 data on tests in the United Kingdom, even reducing the “cycle number by 10 (from, for example, 45 to 35), for the sake of appeasement, the majority of positives would still be uncontroversially positive.” Matthew Binnicker , a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the Mayo Clinic, said the true debate over results at high-cycle threshold values isn’t whether they are “false positives.” “PCR tests are very specific, and these are not false-positives,” he told us in an email. “The test is doing what it was designed to do — detect the viral RNA in samples.” Instead, he said, the tension among scientists concerns whether the values can be used “ to determine whether someone is, or is not, ‘infectious'” to others. In other words, the question isn’t whether someone contracted the coronavirus, but rather, whether that person is likely to still be contagious and should be told to isolate and have their contacts traced. “Some would argue that we should be ignoring low-positive PCR results (i.e., those with a high PCR cycle threshold value), as these results may mean that someone is no longer infectious,” Binnicker said. But, he said, such a result could also mean that a person only very recently became infected and has yet to hit peak infectiousness. And, he cautioned, the quality and type of sample can also affect how many cycles are needed to detect the virus, so it’s not always the case that a high-cycle result means a person is harboring remnants or only small amounts of the virus. Michael Mina , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, likewise said getting positive test results at high-cycle threshold values “doesn’t mean they’re false positive, they’re still actually detecting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA.” Mina said during a call with reporters that the WHO’s memo served as a reminder that “ you have to be discerning about how to evaluate” cycle threshold values. “And if you’re going to start using the actual values from the PCR as part of your decision-making, [it’s important] to really know what it is you’re doing.” For example, if someone is asymptomatic and happened to get a PCR test through testing as part of surveillance in a community, it may be a low viral load detected at a high-cycle threshold value — which could mean “you already were infectious and you maybe don’t need to be isolated,” he said. “But it’s very hard to know that. You need to do repeated testing, you need to take that person and test them again,” he added. “Or, test them with an antigen test. That would be the other way to approach it.” (Antigen tests are a different type of test that can be used to quickly identify an active coronavirus infection.) Binnicker also noted that, since patients who test positive for COVID-19 can sometimes continue to test positive long after recovering, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t recommend PCR tests be used to determine when someone is no longer infectious. Instead, the agency advises relying on time and symptoms to break from quarantine or isolation. Jessica McDonald contributed to this article.

[/INST]  Publicity information, news coverage and even the federal government’s own website about the stimulus did suggest that taxpayers paid for pets to get spayed or neutered as part of an effort to help people exercise outdoors free from the threat of stray dogs. There is a connection between the federal money and the clinics. A program specialist whose salary was paid for through the grant promoted the clinics, and the grant-funded animal control officers were on hand at the clinics. But it’s not accurate to say that the money was used to spay or neuter the animals. And the money did not come from an \"Obamacare slush fund\" -- it wasn't part of the health care law. Calling it a \"slush fund\" could lead readers to view it as a secretive stash of money, when in reality Congress approved the stimulus act that included money for community-based prevention.

While there, Harris announced a $20 billion investment in clean energy initiatives. During her speech, Harris said, “When we invest in clean energy and electric vehicles and reduce population, more of our children can breathe clean air and drink clean water.” The official White House transcript shows Harris misspoke. She had intended to say “reduce pollution,” not “reduce population.” The transcript provides this correction in brackets alongside the original wording, which is crossed out. But some social media posts have spread the video of her mistake without mentioning the correction. One post shared the video with a caption that read, “Watch: Kamala Harris Admits Her Goal Is To REDUCE POPULATION To Fight ‘Climate Change.’ END THE CLIMATE INSANITY!” A comment on that post said, “If they want to reduce population we definitely should start with them.” Conservative radio show host Joe Pags also posted the video , adding that Harris “wasn’t supposed to say that out loud.” “Reduce population?” Pags said in the video. “That’s why the push for abortion. That’s why the push for trans ideology. I get it now.” But Harris merely misspoke. The conservative New York Post reported on the vice president’s error– calling it a “gaffe”– and acknowledged the White House’s correction. We reached out to the White House and Harris’ office for comment, but they didn’t respond. A White House official did respond to Lead Stories and confirmed that Harris meant to say “pollution.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Ongoing Clinical Trials Will Decide Whether (or Not) Ivermectin Is Safe, Effective for COVID-19\". [/INST] The Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of ivermectin, an antiparasitic medication, to treat or prevent COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Ivermectin is approved for human use only to treat some conditions caused by parasites, such as intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis, head lice, and skin conditions. Although the National Institutes of Health counts over 70 studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 in humans, the FDA says “currently available data do not show ivermectin is effective against COVID-19,” and using the medication for this purpose in humans or animals “can be highly dangerous” in some instances. Yet, at a town hall, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said the drug was not officially available because researchers were “unwilling to objectively study” the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 out of “hatred” for former President Donald Trump. “The hatred for Trump deranged these people so much that they’re unwilling to objectively study it,” Paul told constituents on Friday, Aug. 27, after a woman asked why ivermectin wasn’t more available, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer ’s report of the gathering. “So someone like me that’s in the middle on it, I can’t tell you because they will not study ivermectin.” In a subsequent opinion piece published by the Enquirer on Sept. 8, Paul said the paper did not report what he said “accurately.” He said his point was that “we don’t yet know the full story on whether” ivermectin “is effective,” and he acknowledged the drug was in “several studies including a Phase 3 trial for COVID right now.” “I never recommended anyone take Ivermectin,” he wrote. Paul’s remarks came almost a week after the FDA used Twitter to scold those who have been self-medicating with ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19, and a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory showing a rapid and worrisome increase of both ivermectin prescriptions and severe illness associated with its use. The FDA said the agency received “multiple reports” of people requiring “ medical attention, including hospitalization ,” after ingesting ivermectin intended for livestock, which comes in doses that can be toxic for humans. Animal ivermectin, which is different from the one intended for people, helps prevent heartworm disease and other parasites in different animal species.  Both the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health have not recommended the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of clinical trials, citing insufficient evidence. The Infectious Diseases Society of America also suggested against the use of the drug outside of a trial, since there is a “very low certainty of evidence” and “concerns with risk of bias (i.e., study limitations) and imprecision” on 15 studies reviewed by the end of July. On Sept. 1, worried about an alarming increase of calls to poison control centers after ivermectin ingestion, the American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists called for an “immediate end to the prescribing, dispensing, and use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 outside of a clinical trial,” adding that the use of the drug for this purpose “has been demonstrated to be harmful to patients.” “My recommendation is, if people are interested in ivermectin and helping prove what its effect is — and is there a benefit or is there not a benefit —  participate in a clinical trial,” Dr. David Boulware , a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School and a practicing infectious disease physician, told us in a phone interview. “That will help our society get the answers, you know, as quick as possible.” Researchers in the U.S. and across the world have shown great interest in trying to find out if ivermectin, a cheap and widely used antiparasitic drug, could be effectively and safely used to treat COVID-19 patients. As of now, there are 77 studies assessing the use of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19 registered in clinicaltrials.gov , and 139 trials listed in the WHO’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform . “Everybody wanted to do what they could when COVID first struck,” said Edward Mills , a Canadian researcher co-leading one of the largest clinical trials on repurposed treatments to be completed yet . “And those of us working in clinical research, we did what we could too.” Mills was speaking on Aug. 6 while presenting the results for the first time during an event sponsored by the National Institutes of Health."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Spreads Bogus Claims About Plane Crashes and COVID-19 Vaccines\". [/INST] The number of airplane accidents in the U.S. has remained steady over the last five years, even during the pandemic, according to data from the National Transportation Safety Board , which investigates all civil aviation accidents.  In 2020, the NTSB investigated 986 accidents, including 168 fatal crashes. In the previous four years, the NTSB investigated just over 1,000 accidents each year, including about 180 fatal accidents a year. Accidents in the first nine months of this year rose slightly from the same time frame a year ago — 795 this year , 777 last year . But misinformation peddlers are spreading the falsehood that there’s been a significant increase in accidents due to COVID-19 vaccinations, claiming that pilots have been suffering from side effects while flying. “There’s a silent epidemic of plane crashes happening around the country and nobody is connecting the dots,” says the voice-over in one widely viewed video . That video focuses on an Oct. 11 crash in Southern California in which the pilot of a small plane went down over a residential community, killing one person on the ground and injuring two others. “It’s clear that the pilot was having a stroke,” the video claims. “The pilot was a doctor from a hospital and was required to get the vaccine. We know of many cases of pilots suffering strokes after getting the vaccine. That’s why they’re going on strike. It’s one of the many known side effects of this vaccine.” But it’s not clear that the pilot had a stroke, nor is it true that strokes are a “known” side effect of COVID-19 vaccines. The most c ommon side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines include injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and fever, as we’ve explained before . In rare cases, the vaccines may cause more serious problems, such as anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction that has occurred in 2 to 5 people per million, according to the CDC. Such a reaction “can occur after any vaccination,” not just the COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC says. The FDA also has warned of an observed increased risk associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome and a blood clotting disorder coupled with low levels of platelets that has appeared almost exclusively in women below the age of 50. There is also emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle or of the surrounding lining, particularly in young men. It’s also false that airline pilots have been striking — a claim we addressed in another story . The investigation of the accident in California is ongoing, but there’s no evidence to suggest that the pilot, who also died, was having a vaccine-related reaction. While it’s true that the pilot was a doctor, it’s false that his employer required vaccination. Dr. Sugata Das worked at the Yuma Regional Medical Center, which does not currently mandate COVID-19 vaccination, a spokeswoman told us. NTSB’s preliminary report makes no mention of the COVID-19 vaccine. When we asked the Federal Aviation Administration about the claim, a spokeswoman provided a statement saying, “The FAA has seen no evidence of aircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with COVID-19 vaccines.” It’s pure conjecture to claim that the pilot had a stroke. It’s an even further stretch to claim that the assumed stroke was related to vaccination, since strokes are not associated with COVID-19 vaccines. We could find no evidence of the pilot’s vaccination status. The video then moves on to a clip from the conservative Stew Peters Show that featured Dr. Jane Ruby, who has made dubious claims about the COVID-19 vaccines before. A Delta Air Lines pilot “died in flight within the last, I’d say, 10 days,” Ruby said on the Oct. 11 episode of the show, later claiming that the pilot had received his second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine “several days” earlier. “The captain was speaking normally one moment, then said a few weird things, and then died,” she claimed. “They did land the plane safely.” She concluded, “So, guys, there’s a lot going on in the skies, there’s a lot of risk right now.” But there’s no evidence to support the claim. Delta issued a statement two days later, saying, “ Delta is aware of reports suggesting one of the airline’s pilots passed away from vaccine complications while operating a flight, resulting in an emergency landing. All of these allegations are false.” And, as we said, the FAA is unaware of any such situation. We asked Ruby for evidence of her claims, but she didn’t provide any. Ruby wears a white coat and stethoscope in her photos on social media and uses the title of doctor. S he also filed paperwork in Florida for a company called “Dr. Jane Ruby” and runs a website under that name. However, she is not a physician. When we asked Ruby about her credentials, she responded by email, “I’ve never claimed to be a medical doctor.” Her LinkedIn page , which is no longer active, lists a doctor of education degree from the University of Rochester, which describes that degree as being more practical than a Ph.D. in education and explains that it is meant for those seeking school leadership roles. The university confirmed to us that Ruby did complete that degree. Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Falsely Push Bill Gates-Connected ‘Air’ Vaccine Conspiracy\". [/INST] Some scientists are working on creating inhalable or nasal spray mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Such vaccines have the potential to better prevent infection or transmission of the virus than more typical vaccines that are injected. These vaccines, once authorized or approved, would be taken just like any other vaccine, with a person choosing to be vaccinated. But posts online are falsely claiming that Bill Gates is behind an effort to use inhalable mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to blanket the air and forcibly vaccinate large numbers of people without their consent. “Bill Gates mRNA ‘Air Vaccine’ Approved for Use Against Non-Consenting Humans,” reads one false headline from the People’s Voice, a dubious website we’ve fact-checked in the past . “The air vaccine will ‘indiscriminately’ force jab the entire planet with mRNA, delivering the toxic chemicals straight into a person’s lungs,” the post continues. As we have explained before , the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have a good safety profile and aren’t “toxic.” The article proceeds to weave together a few true things — including the existence of some basic research at Yale University on an mRNA nasal vaccine in mice — to falsely suggest a Bill Gates-backed conspiracy is about to begin. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation told us in an email that the claims in the article were “false.” Other posts have highlighted the same research to suggest the possibility of forced vaccination, sometimes without invoking Bill Gates. In reality, no mRNA versions of an inhalable COVID-19 vaccine have been approved in any country, according to our research, although some non-mRNA designs have been rolled out in places such as China. And scientists say it’s not possible to spray such a vaccine into the air and vaccinate people unwittingly. “It is not possible to do that and achieve vaccination, and it is not what we tested in our studies,” W. Mark Saltzman , a biomedical engineer and one of the scientists leading the work at Yale, told us in an email. The posts also sometimes cite a bioethics paper entitled “Compulsory moral bioenhancement should be covert” to argue that the conspiracy is more plausible. But the paper, which was written by a single academic, is specifically about moral bioenhancement, which the author defines as “the potential practice of influencing a person’s moral behavior by way of biological intervention upon their moral attitudes, motivations, or dispositions.” This is a theoretical concept, as currently there is no biological way to modify a person’s moral behavior. Moreover, the article is only arguing a conditional — that if moral bioenhancement is compulsory, then it should be covertly administered. It is not directly relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. The post “cuts up different pieces of information and pieces it together into a Frankenstein theory,” Dr. Angela K. Shen , a vaccine and public health expert at the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard David Institute of Health Economics, told us. “But it doesn’t really work that way.” As supposed evidence of the plot, the People’s Voice article cites an August study published in Science Translational Medicine by researchers at Yale University. “A team from Yale University developed the method for delivering the dangerous chemicals into people’s lungs,” the post incorrectly claims. But the study, which was performed in mice, is only evidence that scientists are working on developing an mRNA nasal vaccine. “This basic science study found that mRNA molecules delivered intranasally to the lungs of research animals can be used to effectively vaccinate against the COVID virus,” Saltzman said. “Contrary to reports on social media,” Saltzman said, spraying the vaccine in the air to mass vaccinate non-consenting people “would not work in humans and this study did not involve humans. Humans must receive a controlled dose that is administered directly into the nose.” Shen also noted that “when something goes airborne, it dilutes things,” making the prospect of trying to forcibly vaccinate a population by spraying a vaccine highly implausible. The Yale paper’s main innovation is the polymer nanoparticles used to deliver the mRNA into the lung. Alone, mRNA is very unstable, and won’t get past layers of mucus inside the body or into cells and do anything. At the same time, previous delivery systems scientists have tested have caused lung inflammation. This design appeared to balance those concerns, at least in mice. But more testing is needed, including in humans, before the vaccine, if successful, would ever become available. Shen, who is also a retired captain in the U.S. Public Health Service, estimated it would take closer to eight to 10 years for such a vaccine to get to market. Saltzman added that there was “no funding from Bill Gates or his foundation,” consistent with the funding sources listed in his study. The only connection to Bill Gates we were able to find is a general interest in nasal spray vaccines, which generally are not mRNA-based. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has helped fund other research into nasal vaccines and participated in a virtual workshop about such vaccines for COVID-19 in November 2022, for example. But as we said, the foundation called the allegations in the posts false, and as we’ll explain in more detail below, there are good public health reasons to want to invest in nasal vaccines. This interest is not evidence of a conspiracy to forcibly vaccinate anyone. Scientists are interested in nasal spray and other so-called mucosal vaccines primarily because by targeting the mucosal tissues where respiratory infections first take hold, they might better prevent infection than injected vaccines. As pointed out in a summary of the November 2022 workshop on mucosal vaccines for COVID-19, even if such vaccines aren’t able to prevent infection entirely, they may still reduce viral shedding more than injected vaccines, which would reduce transmission of the virus. This, in turn, would more effectively limit surges of disease, lower the number of people who develop long COVID and reduce the risk of creating new COVID-19 variants. Another advantage of mucosal vaccines is that they are easier to administer. This is helpful to everyone, but could be especially valuable in poorer parts of the world. “A needleless delivery device is a better delivery method for lower and middle income countries,” Shen told us from Sierra Leone, where she is doing some work. Since many people are afraid of needles, a needle-free vaccine is also likely to appeal to many people who would like to be vaccinated, but can’t get over their fear. Relatively few mucosal vaccines exist, however, especially for respiratory illnesses. There is only one Food and Drug Administration-approved nasal spray vaccine. That vaccine, FluMist, uses weakened flu viruses to protect against seasonal influenza. There are no inhalable or nasal spray COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved in the U.S. The government, however, is putting money behind at least two designs, neither of which use mRNA — again, with the hope that these easier-to-administer vaccines would also better reduce spread of the coronavirus. Outside the U.S., there are a few non-mRNA designs from India, China, Russia and Iran with authorizations or approvals. China authorized the world’s first inhalable COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in September 2022. It is an aerosolized version of the company’s injectable vaccine, which uses an adenovirus — not mRNA — to deliver instructions for making the coronavirus’ spike protein. The inhalable vaccine uses an individual cup dispenser to transform the vaccine liquid into a mist that can be breathed in.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Spread Dubious Claim About Ivermectin and Male Fertility\". [/INST] As an increasing number of people in the U.S. have turned to the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to try to prevent or treat COVID-19, social media posts have claimed that the medication — which has not been proven to be effective against the disease — could impact the reproductive health of men. “TIL Ivermectin apparently sterilizes the majority (85%) of men that take it,” reads a since-deleted Sept. 5 tweet that was turned into an image and shared on Facebook, for example. Another Facebook post commenting on the drug included a screen capture of the headline of a KTSM-TV story that also has been retracted. “Ivermectin causes sterilization in 85 percent of men, study finds,” was the heading of that Sept. 8 article. But that was not the conclusion of the 2011 Nigerian study mentioned in the article or linked to in the tweet. The introduction section of that study said a different report published in 2002 found that “85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with ivermectin in the recent past” developed “sperm dysfunctions,” such as low sperm counts and poor sperm motility or movement. However, the 2011 study didn’t say that the sperm dysfunctions mentioned in the 2002 report meant that those men were suddenly infertile. “I don’t think the study conclusively provides any evidence to show that ivermectin causes infertility,” Dr. Puneet Masson , director of Male Reproductive Medicine and Surgery at Penn Medicine Urology, told FactCheck.org in an interview. Ivermectin , in tablet form, has only been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans to treat certain parasitic worms. A topical formulation has been approved by the FDA for external use against parasites such as head lice and for skin conditions such as rosacea. There is also an FDA-approved version of ivermectin to treat certain internal and external parasites in animals. But animal drugs should never be taken by humans, the FDA says. As for side effects, the FDA does list several that have been associated with ivermectin for people, such as skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, swelling, dizziness and seizures. But male infertility or sterility is not one of them. “Infertility in men is not a known side effect of ivermectin and is not included as a side effect in the labeling,” an FDA spokesperson said in an email to FactCheck.org. “The labeling for ivermectin and its bioequivalents states that ivermectin had no adverse effects on the fertility in rats in studies at repeated doses of up to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose of 200 mcg/kg (on a mg/m2/day basis). ” The FDA’s statement, along with other factors, led the El Paso, Texas-based news station to pull its article. “FOR THE RECORD: A national story regarding Ivermectin and a study regarding its effect on men’s reproductive health that KTSM published, has been removed from our website,” KTSM investigative reporter Erin Coulehan , the author of the original story, wrote in a Sept. 9 correction . “Concerns over the scientific research methods, the veracity of the original, peer-reviewed report and public statements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) saying that infertility is not a known side effect of Ivermectin all led to our editorial decision to remove the story.” Despite the retraction — and numerous fact – checking articles casting doubt on the claim — people on social media continue to assert that ivermectin makes men sterile. The 2011 study was published in the Archives of Applied Science Research , which is purported to be a “peer-reviewed, open-access journal.” A copy of the study is available online via the Scholars Research Library . The authors tested the effect of ivermectin on the sperm functions of a small number of Nigerian men who were given the drug for 11 months to treat onchocerciasis , a tropical illness also known as river blindness, which is caused by parasitic worms transmitted through repeated bites by blackflies. While 385 men with the disease were initially screened for the study, only 37 of them — between the ages of 27 and 58 — had normal sperm counts that made them eligible for further testing. The other men with “very low sperm counts” were excluded. Subsequently, the authors “observed significant reduction in the sperm counts and sperm motility of the patients tested,” but did not “record any significant change or alteration in the sperm viscosity, sperm volume, and sperm liquefaction time of the patients.” Overall, the authors said, the results indicated the drug could cause infertility in the patients, which led the researchers to “suggest that caution be seriously exercised in the treatment of male onchocerciasis patients with ivermectin to avoid the adverse effects it has on the patients’ sperm functions.” But Masson , who is also an assistant professor of clinical urology in surgery at the University of Pennsylvania, told us the study had several issues. His primary concern was the sample size and the health of the patients. “They threw out basically more than 90% of their study patients that were in their dataset because they had abnormal semen parameters,” he said. “So my question is: Is something but the underlying disease causing people to be infertile?” (The study did not include a control group of patients with the disease who did not receive ivermectin.) He also said that while the study did show some of the men had a “numerical decline” in their sperm concentration and motility, which are measurements of the amount and movement of the sperm, it wasn’t a “clinically significant” decrease, because the numbers didn’t drop below the “normal values” used for comparison in the study. That would not make the men infertile, Masson said, noting that the study did not include any actual pregnancy data to suggest that the men had difficulty achieving a pregnancy compared with anybody else. As we pointed out earlier, the authors of the study did not say ivermectin causes sterility in 85% of men — which is how many promoted their research online. The 85% statistic — which was worded differently — was mentioned in the study’s introduction, but was attributed to another source. “A recent report showed that 85% of all male patients treated in a particular centre with ivermectin in the recent past who went to the laboratory for routine tests were discovered to have developed various forms, grades and degrees of sperm dysfunctions,” the authors wrote. No other details about the report were provided in the 2011 study. A footnote indicated that the source was a 2002 paper published in the Journal of Biomedical Investigation , but we could not find it by accessing online databases for journals, or when doing an internet search. The African Journals Online resource has some archived editions of the journal, but only going back to 2003 — when AJOL says the first volume was published. We tried contacting the authors of the 2011 study for comment on their work — and to obtain a copy of the 2002 report they referenced — but we did not receive a response. What we do know is that the 10-year-old Nigerian study alone is not evidence that ivermectin makes the vast majority of male users sterile. And without more information about the 2002 report, it’s not possible to say if it supports the claim, either.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"No Surge in Athlete Deaths, Contrary to Widespread Anti-Vaccine Claims\". [/INST] For more than a year, anti-vaccine campaigners have been spreading the unfounded claim that athletes are in the grip of a health crisis — suggesting that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a surge in sudden deaths and injuries. This baseless theory, which had been simmering in niche channels online, flooded social media after Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin, 24, collapsed during a game on Jan. 2 in front of millions of TV viewers . He has since been discharged from the hospital to recover at home. As we’ve explained , it’s not yet known why his heart stopped, but experts say Hamlin’s cardiac arrest was likely caused by an arrhythmia following a blow to his chest, called commotio cordis. Update, April 19: While announcing he had been medically cleared to return to football, Hamlin said in an April 18 news conference that doctors had diagnosed him with commotio cordis, with the hit to his chest triggering his cardiac arrest. But prominent anti-vaccine influencers quickly posted claims on social media suggesting that the incident was somehow related to vaccination and part of a sinister trend. For example, Ben Swann, who has spread misinformation about the pandemic since 2020, posted on Facebook on Jan. 3 an old video promoting the unsupported theory that there’s a recent surge in athlete deaths. The same day, conservative commentator Liz Wheeler and Dr. Simone Gold — who has peddled dubious cures for COVID-19, anti-vaccination messages and politicized medical misinformation — posted similar claims . Gold wrote , in part, “I want to remind the public that athletes being incapacitated or dropping dead was not a ‘thing’ prior to 2020. We are now seeing this happen very frequently, and it’s extremely concerning.” Both Wheeler and Gold cited a letter to the editor published in the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology that was co-authored by Dr. Peter McCullough, another prominent purveyor of COVID-19 misinformation.  Although its publication may give the letter a veneer of legitimacy, the letter did not include any original research, as suggested by Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson. Rather, it relied upon an arbitrary list of athlete deaths maintained on an anonymous website that we wrote about shortly after it appeared online in late 2021. As we explained before , the list includes students, professionals, amateurs, coaches and retirees. It includes people who died by suicide , car crash and drug overdose . The list does not — in nearly all cases — include the vaccination status of the deceased, let alone prove any causal relationship between vaccines and the deaths. In fact, as we’ve previously reported, some of the deaths initially listed happened before the vaccines had even become available to the age category for the person listed. Wheeler and Gold, though, each shared an image that highlighted a portion of the letter comparing the number of deaths listed on the anonymous website with the number of sudden cardiac deaths among athletes that had appeared in academic literature over a 38-year period as compiled in a 2006 paper . The two figures reflect different criteria. One number is very broad and includes anyone with a passing relationship to sports who died for any reason since 2021, while the other is conspicuously narrow and includes only the deaths of athletes that were analyzed in English-language academic research papers. Although the comparison they make is meaningless, Wheeler and Gold leave the false impression that there’s been a surge in deaths and further the baseless narrative that there’s been an increase in athlete injuries and deaths since the COVID-19 vaccines became available. But the surge is fiction. It doesn’t exist. “There is no uptick in sudden cardiac arrest or death in athletes due to COVID-19 or from COVID vaccinations. This is total misinformation,” Dr. Jonathan Drezner told us in an emailed statement. Drezner is the director of the UW Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology at the University of Washington, editor in chief of the British Journal of Sports Medicine , and a team physician for the Seattle Seahawks, the OL Reign soccer team and the University of Washington Huskies. More than 2,000 children and adolescents in the U.S. die from sudden cardiac arrest every year, according to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia , and two-thirds of the deaths “occur during exercise or activity.” Among young athletes, sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death, according to CHOP. Drezner said his center monitors “all cases and all causes” of sudden cardiac arrest or death in athletes by working with the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “[T]here is no change,” he said. The National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research catalogs injuries for high school and college athletes, and its most recent report covers the 2020-21 school year. It shows that 21 athletes died while playing their sport that year. COVID-19 vaccines were available to everyone 16 and over in the U.S. by April 2021, so the overlap between the period covered by the report and the period in which vaccines were widely available to young people was relatively small. We reached out to the center to find out if the data collected for the 2021-2022 school year has indicated any increase in deaths. The center’s director, Dr. Kristen Kucera, told us that so far, “the numbers are the same and it’s actually fewer than we captured in 2018-19.” For context, the center reported 19 deaths in 2019-20, 25 deaths in 2018-19 and 21 deaths in 2017-18. Similarly, Dr. Robert Cantu , the center’s medical director, told us in an emailed statement that he’s seen no increase in athlete deaths and called the claims “misinformation.” “The statistics don’t bear out that there’s been an increase in events among athletes,” Dr. Curt Daniels , professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of the sports cardiology program at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. The field of sports cardiologists who oversee the health of athletes is relatively small, Daniels said. “We talk and communicate all the time,” he said, and none of his colleagues has flagged a rise in sudden cardiac arrest. “There’s been no increase,” he said. Also, Daniels noted, there’s a high vaccination rate among athletes in part because many organizations require vaccination to participate. He noted that a rare side effect of the mRNA vaccines is heart inflammation, or myocarditis, which has primarily affected young men between 12 and 24 years old after a second dose, as we’ve explained before . The risk is highest for males ages 16 to 17, at 106 cases per million doses after the second dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those cases have appeared to resolve faster and have better clinical outcomes when compared with the more common cases of myocarditis caused by viral infection, including from the virus that causes COVID-19. Despite that, anti-vaccine campaigners have distorted the rare vaccine side effect as being more common than it is, using that misrepresentation in claims about increases in athlete deaths. For those who develop myocarditis, stressing the heart with intense physical activity could create an arrhythmia resulting in a cardiac event, Daniels said. “And, in fact,” Daniels said, “we have not seen an increase in events.” So, he said, if the vaccines were causing an increase in sudden deaths, “we would be seeing it here and we’re not.” As we said, an anonymous website called Good Sciencing is one of the primary sources used to make the claim about a surge in sudden deaths among athletes. The site retains the same problems we identified when we first wrote about it soon after it showed up online in late 2021. Regardless, its use by anti-vaccine activists has continued to spread. Now it’s the source of the information in the letter to the editor cited by both Wheeler and Gold. This recent version of the claim compares the number of athletes listed on the website with numbers compiled in an unrelated 2006 paper , which sought to develop a system to screen athletes for heart problems in order to reduce the number of sudden cardiac deaths in sports. In the Gold and Wheeler tweets, a highlighted portion of McCullough’s letter to the editor says that 1,101 athletes have died since January 2021, citing the Good Sciencing list . The letter then cites the 2006 study to say that the same number had died in the 38-year period covered by the paper. Gold and Wheeler emphasized the part equating that to about 29 deaths per year, implying there had been 1,101 athlete deaths in the previous year compared with an average of 29 athlete deaths per year before the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced. But, as we said, the Good Sciencing list and the 2006 paper use different criteria for age, athletic affiliation, cause of death and the sources used to record the deaths. The Good Sciencing website counts deaths from any cause for all ages among those who were listed in media reports to have some association with sports, including professional athletes, hikers, retirees and coaches. The 2006 paper counted sudden cardiac deaths among athletes younger than 35 years old that had appeared in English-language academic literature in a 38-year period starting in 1966. So, comparing those numbers doesn’t mean much, since they’re measuring different things. There is also an important difference in the sources used to record the number of deaths. Because the 2006 paper drew only from deaths reported in academic literature, the total number is limited. The paper itself notes that its “most important limitation” is that sudden cardiac death in young athletes “as reported in the published and studied papers is certainly underestimated.” It goes on to say that “the lack of national or international registers and the uncertainty of the number of athletes involved forms the basis of this problem.” We found the same problem in reporting on this issue, too. The only functioning repository collecting information on athlete deaths in all sports that we could find in the U.S. was the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research. The Minneapolis Heart Institute had once run the U.S. National Registry of Sudden Death in Athletes, but it’s no longer maintaining the registry, the institute’s Dr. Kevin Harris told us in a phone interview. While it was still functioning, that registry was used in a 2009 paper that assessed the incidence of sudden death in U.S. athletes who were 39 and younger. It found that the most common cause of death was “due to underlying (and predominantly unsuspected) cardiovascular disease,” which accounted for more than half of cases, but other causes included blunt trauma and heat stroke. Most of those cardiovascular deaths — 93% — were among athletes who were 25 or younger and the total number of those deaths each year was under 100. “We spent a lot of time tabulating death rates in young athletes,” Dr. Barry Maron , the lead author of the paper, told us in a phone interview. If there were a significant increase, “we’d know about it,” Maron said. “Kids would be dropping left and right. There hasn’t been that kind of increase.” As we said, the Good Sciencing list is based on a broad definition of what constitutes the sudden death of an athlete and includes people with a tenuous relationship to sports and people who died of things like cancer and bacterial meningitis . “How do you rebut something like that?” Maron said. “It’s like they make up the numbers.”"

[/INST] Health care workers have administered just under 2 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in Afghanistan, which has a population of about 39 million. Vaccination rates slowed further in August amid upheaval as U.S. troops pulled out of the country and the Taliban took over. There was an 80% drop in the number of Afghans provided with the opportunity to receive COVID-19 vaccines in August, Tess Ingram, a spokeswoman for UNICEF, told us by email. UNICEF is handling the delivery of vaccines for the COVAX consortium that provides COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. “COVID vaccine administration has slowed in the last month but hasn’t stopped completely,” Ingram said of the situation in Afghanistan. But, as partisan rhetoric about the pull-out intensified, two prominent purveyors of misinformation made false or misleading claims about Afghanistan’s low vaccination rate and used those claims to suggest that vaccines aren’t necessary to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Ted Nugent , a musician who frequently shares conservative political commentary on social media and has made false claims undermining the COVID-19 vaccines, posted a meme on Facebook that asked, “Can someone tell me how the Taliban survived the last 18 months with no vaccines … to then recapture an entire country with no mass deaths amongst their population during a global pandemic?” And Candace Owens , a conservative commentator who has been vocal about her aversion to the COVID-19 vaccine, tweeted : “Afghanistan has vaccinated approximately 2.4% of their population. (Source: Reuters) They are a nation of about 40 million people. Why aren’t they all dead? Why have they only recorded 7,083 deaths? Bigger question: Why is the Taliban banning the vaccines?” We’ll start with Owens’ claims. There’s no evidence to support the claim that the Taliban is “banning the vaccines.” We reached out to Owens on her Facebook page and through her website to ask what her claim was based on, but she didn’t respond."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Falsely Claim CDC Official Admitted COVID-19 Vaccines Cause ‘Debilitating Illnesses’\". [/INST] The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is an early warning system managed by the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration to detect possible safety issues in vaccines. All reports of health problems happening after vaccination, or adverse events, are accepted into the system, regardless of the plausibility of them being caused by the vaccine. Events reported in VAERS may have been caused by an underlying medical condition, for example, and be coincidental to vaccination. We’ve written about several claims that have misrepresented or misused VAERS data. “As an early warning system, VAERS cannot prove that a vaccine caused a problem. Specifically, a report to VAERS does not mean that a vaccine caused an adverse event,” the CDC explains (CDC’s emphasis). “But VAERS can give CDC and FDA important information. If it looks as though a vaccine might be causing a problem, FDA and CDC will investigate further and take action if needed.” COVID-19 vaccines are remarkably safe and effective, but mild and temporary side effects may occur, including pain at the injection site, muscle aches and fever. Since the vaccines became available over two years ago, safety surveillance studies have identified four severe adverse events associated with vaccination. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, have been associated with anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that also can occur after other kinds of vaccination, and rare cases of heart inflammation, mostly in young males, after a second dose. Two other very rare conditions are associated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which has accounted for only a small percentage of the vaccines administered in the U.S. Yet, social media posts falsely claim that during a meeting with the FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the CDC’s director of immunization safety, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, admitted COVID-19 vaccines cause “debilitating illnesses.” “JUST IN: As Today’s VRBPAC Meeting Ended, CDC Dep. Dir. Tom Shimabukuro Admits COVID Vaccines Are Causing ‘Debilitating Illnesses’ ‘We are aware of these reports of people experiencing long-lasting health problems following COVID vaccination,’” a Twitter user wrote on Jan. 26 , including a minute-long video clip of Shimabukuro’s statements. Similar posts have been shared on social media platforms in several languages including English , Italian , Thai , French , Polish , Portuguese and Spanish . Some use a slighter longer version of Shimabukuro’s statement. Shimabukuro, however, was simply acknowledging that some people have reported debilitating conditions following vaccination to VAERS. He was not saying that those conditions were caused by COVID-19 vaccination. In a statement, Shimabukuro told us: “Currently, there are no epidemiologic data from safety monitoring to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines are causing” debilitating and long-lasting health problems, other than the rare conditions already identified . The comments circulating on social media stem from the most recent meeting of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, VRBPAC, held on Jan. 26. The meeting was set to discuss future vaccination regimes, and it included an update on COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness and safety. During the morning presentations, experts had explained how they use one of the other vaccine safety monitoring systems, the Vaccine Safety Datalink , to detect potential safety issues, through what they call a rapid cycle analysis, in which specific outcomes are assessed weekly. Later in the afternoon, Dr. Hayley Gans, a member of VRBPAC, asked panelists about other ways potential safety issues are being detected. “I do think that you very well articulated the current VSD and the rapid cycle, and all that is very encouraging and is really robust,” she said , according to the meeting transcript . “I guess the question that I would have is how overall are we also handling some other potential ways in which these vaccines are impacting our population? So obviously we heard some reports and there’s some data out there. So how are we tracking, for instance, potential autoimmune and other of those entities that maybe aren’t amenable to the rapid cycle?” Shimabukuro answered the question as follows (the part highlighted in the social media posts is in bold): As we said, so far, there are only a few rare severe adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccination. All of them were detected and assessed by the vaccine safety monitoring systems in place. This allowed authorities to modify vaccination guidance appropriately to protect the public. Vaccines continue to be closely monitored for safety. Recently, health authorities disclosed a potential safety concern for strokes in people over 65 after a Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent booster. But as we’ve written , the safety signal was observed in just one monitoring system, and no causal relationship has been found. It’s worth noting that some people infected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, go on to experience long COVID , which can include long-lasting and debilitating health problems. Multiple studies have found that COVID-19 vaccination may lower the risk of developing long COVID, especially after two or more doses. In that sense, it’s possible the COVID-19 vaccines protect against “debilitating illnesses.”"

While other countries give more relative to the size of their economy, the total volume of dollars matters most in terms of being able to provide more food, shelter and medical care. However, countries that host refugees also provide humanitarian assistance in ways that are not so easily tallied. Those efforts should factor into an assessment of each nation’s level of aid.

[/INST] One of Russia’s tactics in attempts to cause fear in Ukraine and among its NATO allies has been the use of nuclear blackmail. In a national address in September , Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened Western countries and Ukraine by stating, “I want to remind those who allow themselves such statements about Russia that our country also has a variety of weapons of destruction, and in some areas even more modern than those in NATO countries. We will without question use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. This is not a bluff.” In response, U.S. officials said that the consequences would be “catastrophic” and “horrific” if Russia were to use nuclear weapons. In November, Chinese President Xi Jinping, largely friendly to Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, offered a rebuke to Russia’s nuclear threats, saying the international community should “jointly oppose the use of or threats to use nuclear weapons.” In an address and discussion at the Lowy Institute , a think tank in Sydney, Australia, in October, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked what else NATO could do to deter Russia from using nuclear weapons. Zelensky responded by saying, through an interpreter, that his expectations for the international community were to take “preventive strikes, preventive actions so that Russia would know what would happen to them and not in return, I mean, waiting for the nuclear strikes first…” These statements, said in Ukrainian and translated into English, caused a swift response from the Kremlin. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated, “Zelensky’s words to NATO are nothing more than a call to start a world war with unpredictable and monstrous consequences.” Zelensky’s spokesman, Sergii Nykyforov, clarified the president’s comments in an Oct. 6 Facebook post saying, “The President spoke about the period until February 24 [2022]. Then it was necessary to apply preventive measures to prevent Russia from starting the war. Let me remind you that the only measures that were about then were preventive sanctions.” Zelensky’s advisor Mykhailo Podolyak also clarified the statements on Twitter on Oct. 6, saying that Zelensky “said nothing about a preventative nuclear strike on [Russian Federation]. Zelensky reminded about Russian nuclear blackmail and suggested to preemptively outline the consequences for Russia and intensify strikes against it – sanctions [against Russia] and armed assistance to [Ukraine].” On Oct. 8, Zelensky himself clarified his comments at the Lowy Institute in an interview with the BBC stating, “You must use preventative kicks, not attacks.” He also said that the response to his comments was an attempt by Russia to “retranslate” his words. Despite the clarifications, numerous social media accounts in February resurfaced Zelensky’s speech from four months ago, highlighting his “preventive actions” comment. A Feb. 12 Facebook post captioned in Spanish, read, “Zelensky pide atque nuclear preventivo contra Rusia,” and amassed 140,000 views. An English-language version of the caption — “Zelensky calls for preventative nuclear attack against Russia”– has since been taken down. A French far-right political commentator shared a clip on Twitter on Feb. 2 with edited English subtitles that claim Zelensky stated, “They can use nuclear weapons on Russia” and “we need to launch preemptive strikes so that they know what will happen to them if they use it…” The tweet received more than 350,000 views and has been shared widely on Twitter. The news station France 24 debunked the clip and verified that the English subtitles in the clip were not what Zelensky said in Ukrainian."

We acknowledge that there are a range of opinions on this matter, but it has become clearer since our prior attempts to tackle this question that the ratings agencies are willing to overlook any defaults beyond those involving bondholders when they measure the nation's creditworthiness. By virtue of their position, the ratings agencies carry significant weight on this question. We believe that the nation can be in default on some obligations even if the agencies choose to ignore them as they calculate their ratings.. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Immigrants’ Eligibility for Social Security Numbers, Benefits\". [/INST] The flow of immigrants across the southern border hit a record high at the end of 2023, the Pew Research Center reported, and immigration has become a dominant issue in this election season. But, as we’ve written, politicians and social media posts have spread misinformation exaggerating immigration numbers and distorting the political impact of immigrants in the U.S. Another persistent yet false claim about immigrants in the country illegally and Social Security benefits is also circulating again. Immigrants who are not authorized to be in the United States are not eligible for such benefits, as we’ve previously written . An April 12 Facebook post , however, claims, “Illegal immigrants get BOTH social security numbers AND Social Security BENEFITS!! This massive story has been BURIED by the mainstream media!! This information can now be found right on the government’s website. If social security — that we as taxpayers have paid into our entire lives — is ‘broke’… then why are we expanding benefits to those are not citizens and not here legally???” A nearly identical claim was posted on Instagram and received more than 2,500 likes. The posts show two sections on the Social Security Administration’s website purportedly to back up their claims. But the posts misrepresent the government’s programs and who’s entitled to receive benefits. In one section shown in the posts, titled “Social Security Numbers for Noncitizens,” the Social Security Administration says (emphasis ours), “Generally, only noncitizens authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security” can get a Social Security number, which is “used to report a person’s wages to the government and to determine that person’s eligibility for Social Security benefits.” Nilsa Henriquez, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, confirmed to us in an email, “In order for a person to be assigned a Social Security number (SSN), they must meet our evidence requirements and be a United States citizen; or an individual lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence; or an individual lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis who has Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authorization to work.” Social Security numbers can also be assigned to “an individual with a valid nonwork reason… For example, they need an SSN because of a federal or state law requiring an SSN to get a benefit or service,” Henriquez said. Many of the immigrants arriving at the U.S. southern border in recent years have sought asylum, claiming they fear returning to their home countries because of persecution and other dangers. “While asylum seekers who have come across the border do not have any kind of durable legal status in the United States, they are legally allowed to stay in the country while their asylum application is pending,” Julia Gelatt, associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, told us in an April 26 email. “It is legal to request asylum, no matter how one entered the United States.” “Of all of the foreign-born people who enter the United States each year, most are coming with some kind of legal status – a green card for permanent residence, refugee status, or a temporary visa like a student visa, H-2A farmworker visa, or H-1B high-skilled work visa. Under the Biden administration, many people – but a smaller number than those entering with visas — are also entering the United States with humanitarian parole, which grants the temporary right to live and work in the United States,” Gelatt said. “Asylum seekers whose application has been pending for more than six months who apply for and are granted work authorization can get SSNs,” Gelatt also said. “People who cross the border illegally who have not applied for asylum usually cannot get work authorization or an SSN.” So, immigrants can receive a Social Security number, provided they are “authorized to work” in the U.S. and are “lawfully admitted” to the U.S. when they apply. The social media posts also show a section of the SSA website titled, “Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for Noncitizens.” That section explains that noncitizens may be eligible for SSI payments if they are “lawfully admitted for permanent residence, granted conditional entry, paroled into the United States, admitted as a refugee, granted asylum, an alien whose removal is being withheld,” or if they fall into another classification of immigrants from specific countries such as Cuba, Haiti, Iraq or Afghanistan. In addition, a noncitizen must be “lawfully residing” in the U.S. or fall into another specific category to receive SSI payments. By citing the information about SSI, the social media posts confuse that program with Social Security retirement benefits. Both programs are managed by the Social Security Administration, but they are not the same. SSI is a “needs-based program for people with limited income and resources” who are elderly or disabled, the Social Security Administration explains. The program is funded through general tax revenues, and the amount a person receives is based on federal and state laws which “take into account where you live, who lives with you and what income you receive.” The social media posts refer to Social Security as a program “that we as taxpayers have paid into our entire lives” and “is broke.” The Social Security retirement program is the one workers pay into throughout their lives. It is an entitlement program funded through taxes paid by workers and employers and collected into trust funds. A recipient’s payments are based on work history and earnings. Many critics warn the program is going broke, but that’s not accurate. Unless the program is changed or new revenues are raised, the reserves of the Social Security trust fund related to the retirement portion of the program are projected to become depleted in 2033. At that time the program would only have enough income to pay 77% of scheduled retirement benefits, according to the latest report from the trustees overseeing the program. The Social Security Administration says on its website (emphasis ours), “ Lawfully present noncitizens of the United States who meet all eligibility requirements can qualify for Social Security benefits.” Henriquez, the SSA spokesperson, told us, “In terms of benefits, in addition to several specific eligibility requirements, each Social Security program also has a United States lawful presence payment provision which applies to retirement, survivors, or disability benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).” Gelatt, of the Migration Policy Institute, said, “Just because someone can get an SSN does not mean they are immediately eligible for Social Security benefits. … Someone in the US is not eligible for Social Security disability or old-age benefits until they have accrued enough work history in the United States – that’s usually at least about 10 years of work, and they have to be ‘lawfully present’ … to be eligible to receive the benefits even once they have that work history.” Contrary to the claims in the social media posts, someone who is not authorized to be in the U.S. is not eligible for benefits of the Social Security retirement program that is financed by a payroll tax on employers and employees."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Make Unfounded Claims After Newsom Gets COVID-19 Booster\". [/INST] California Gov. Gavin Newsom received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in April, and received a Moderna COVID-19 booster shot at an Oakland health clinic on Oct. 27. Newsom was expected to attend the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, two days later, but he canceled the trip, citing “ family obligations. ” Newsom then spent 12 days without any public events, leading to unsubstantiated rumors that he had suffered from health issues due to the COVID-19 booster. Social media posts spreading the claims drew more than 25,000 interactions on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics . One Facebook post made the unfounded claim that “Gavin Newsom is in the hospital laid up with Guillain Barre syndrome as a result of an adverse reaction to his booster shot.” Other articles reported, without any evidence, that Newsom suffered from “ vaccine injury ” or “ Bell’s palsy .” An article on Nov. 8 in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination publication, The Defender, claimed that a source close to Newsom said he suffered symptoms that “ were similar to those associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), a known side effect of many vaccines.” The NOQ Report , a website based in California, claimed on Nov. 8, “ Whether it’s Bell’s Palsy or something else, it seems to be tied to the booster shot.” We don’t know why Newsom spent nearly two weeks without participating in any official public event, but Newsom’s staff and his wife denied the claims. On Nov. 8, a spokesperson for Newsom told The Center Square , “ No, the Governor did not have any adverse reaction to his booster shot.” A statement issued by the governor’s office, responding to the social media rumors that he had been hospitalized, appeared Nov. 9 in a New York Times article: “Last week Governor Newsom worked in the Capitol with staff on urgent issues including Covid-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California’s continued economic recovery. He will have public events this week related to the economy and vaccines.” Newsom’s wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, also responded to the rumors surrounding her husband’s absence in a now deleted tweet on Nov. 7 reading, “ It’s funny how certain folks can’t handle truth. When someone cancels something, maybe they’re just in the office working; maybe in their free time they’re at home with their family, at their kids’ sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life.” During his brief time out of the public eye, Newsom appeared in a video posted Nov. 4 on Twitter in which he sent his best wishes to those celebrating the holidays of Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas. Newsom also reportedly attended the wedding of billionaire heiress Ivy Getty at San Francisco City Hall on Nov. 7. Then, on Nov. 9, Newsom spoke at the California Economic Summit — his first public event appearance following COP26 — where he acknowledged his absence from COP26, noting he spent time with his family and attending to various official duties. At the summit, Newsom explained that his children were upset that he and his wife would be missing Halloween to go to COP26, so he decided to cancel the trip and stay home with them. There is a photo of Newsom and his wife with their children dressed up for Halloween that was posted on Newsom’s Instagram account on Nov. 1. He also responded to the flurry of online rumors, saying, “We’d all do well taking some time away from social media.” As for claims that Newsom had suffered symptoms that “ were similar to those associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome,” there is no evidence that he suffered such symptoms. In the trials for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, as we’ve previously reported , there was a slightly higher number of cases of Bell’s palsy , a form of temporary facial paralysis, in the vaccine group. With three instances out of more than 15,000 recipients of the Moderna vaccine and one in a similarly sized placebo group, the Food and Drug Administration was unable to determine whether the condition was triggered by the vaccine or not, but the FDA suggested ongoing surveillance. As of July, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s near real-time vaccine safety monitoring system has not observed a safety signal for Bell’s palsy for either of the vaccines. A paper published in April in JAMA Internal Medicine , which reviewed pharmacovigilance data from the World Health Organization, also concluded, “if an association between facial paralysis and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines exists, the risk is likely very low, as with other viral vaccines.” Instances of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, or GBS, have occurred after some vaccines , but they are rare. In this condition, a person’s immune system attacks nerve cells, leading to muscle weakness and, at times, paralysis. Most people who develop GBS fully recover, although some have permanent nerve damage and the condition can be fatal. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA and CDC are investigating a possible increased risk of GBS with the J&J vaccine, based on 250 preliminary cases after more than 15.7 million doses, as of early November. The FDA warned of the possible adverse event in July, noting that there has not been an observed increase in risk for the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"No Indication Breast Milk After Vaccination Unsafe, Despite Posts About New Study\". [/INST] Update, Sept. 25: We have updated this story to include information about a second study from the authors of the original JAMA Pediatrics study. The new study did not find any evidence that the trace amount of vaccine mRNA temporarily found in some vaccinated people’s breast milk is functional. There is no evidence that babies are harmed by drinking breast milk from mothers who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. On the contrary, vaccinated mothers produce antibodies and even some immune cells that recognize the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, in breast milk, which may provide some protection to infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the World Health Organization all recommend that lactating mothers get vaccinated, and none of them recommend withholding breast milk after vaccination. Online posts , however, have seized on a newly published article in JAMA Pediatrics to argue that maternal vaccination is harmful to infants. “7 out of 11 women had mRNA in their breast milk. This isn’t just a disaster for infants, it’s more proof that the mRNA/LNP in the shots hits practically every cell in the body,” one Sept. 26 Instagram post reads, sharing screenshots of the paper and quoting a tweet from Alex Berenson. Berenson is a former New York Times reporter who has repeatedly spread misinformation about COVID-19 and the vaccines.  The study did find mRNA from the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in breast milk samples from several women (it was actually five out of 11 women, not seven, as Berenson said, although he corrected himself on Twitter). But as we’ll explain, the amount of mRNA was exceedingly small, was detected only for up to 48 hours after vaccination, and does not mean that vaccination is hazardous to infants. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines contain modified messenger RNA, or mRNA , which provides the instructions for cells to briefly make some coronavirus spike proteins. This prompts the body to generate a protective immune response, so that if someone encounters SARS-CoV-2, the immune system will already be familiar with the virus and be better able to fight it off. For both vaccines, the mRNA is wrapped in fatty molecules known as lipid nanoparticles to protect and ferry the mRNA into cells, since naked mRNA is otherwise degraded too quickly. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists told us in a statement that while additional research on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination during lactation is welcome, the new findings did not change the group’s guidance that women do not need to avoid starting breastfeeding or to stop breastfeeding after vaccination. “The findings based on a sample of breast milk in 5 women that could be measured (of the eleven) is highly speculative and does not currently represent strong evidence against breastfeeding at any point after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination,” the organization said. “Additionally, the fetal gut when consuming breast milk within the first 48 hours after a maternal vaccination would be expected to rapidly degrade any mRNA that entered it. However, even if mRNA were to be absorbed, the notion that it would be harmful to an infant is not supported by the data presented or any data currently available.” The JAMA Pediatrics study , which was published by researchers at NYU Long Island School of Medicine, looked for the presence of vaccine mRNA in breast milk samples collected from 11 women, between one hour and five days after vaccination with either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. Trace amounts of vaccine mRNA were found in seven samples from five women, up to 45 hours after vaccination. For two of these women, no vaccine mRNA was detectable in whole milk, but some was identified when the researchers used a method to concentrate the number of extracellular vesicles, or tiny fat-coated sacs, to make it more likely they could detect the mRNA. The vesicles are known to be present naturally in breast milk. The amounts of vaccine mRNA in the milk were exceedingly small — less than 12 picograms per milliliter of whole milk, and within the vesicles, not more than 17 picograms per milliliter. These amounts are under 0.02 parts per billion. The paper acknowledged that the study had few participants, and that no tests were performed to determine whether the mRNA was in any way functional and could be used to make protein. Update, Sept. 25: A follow-up study from the same authors, published in the journal eBioMedicine on Sept. 19, 2023, did test for functionality, and did not find any evidence that the tiny amount of vaccine mRNA occasionally found in breast milk is biologically active. The study analyzed 154 breast milk samples taken from 13 postpartum mothers. As before, the authors identified trace amounts of vaccine mRNA in breast milk from some individuals, concentrated in the extracellular vesicles of the milk, always within 48 hours of vaccination. Additional tests revealed that most of the mRNA in the milk was fragmented — only 12% to 25% was intact — and that no spike protein was present. Lab tests also showed that intestinal cells presented with mRNA-positive extracellular vesicles did not proceed to produce any spike protein. These findings indicate that the vaccine mRNA temporarily present in breast milk is biologically inactive. “The sporadic presence and trace quantities of COVID-19 vaccine mRNA detected in EBM suggest that breastfeeding after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is safe, particularly beyond 48 hours after vaccination,” the authors wrote, referring to expressed breast milk. Still, the authors thought the finding was important. “We believe it is safe to breastfeed after maternal COVID-19 vaccination. However, caution is warranted about breastfeeding children younger than 6 months in the first 48 hours after maternal vaccination until more safety studies are conducted,” they added. On the day of publication, JAMA Pediatrics highlighted this part of the paper, writing in a tweet sharing the article, “Trace amounts of #COVID19 vaccine mRNAs were detected in the breast milk of some lactating women. Caution is warranted regarding #breastfeeding infants younger than six months in the first two days after maternal COVID-19 vaccination.” Screenshots of this tweet, along with those of the paper, were subsequently shared on social media — some with little or no commentary, while others were more overt in suggesting the new results meant it was unsafe for vaccinated mothers to breastfeed or that lactating mothers shouldn’t get vaccinated. Multiple experts, including some dismayed by the journal’s tweet, say the findings are not concerning. For one, as Victoria Male , a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told us, and as she details in a continually updated online explainer , the results are not particularly new. Two other papers have also found vaccine mRNA in breast milk from some — but not all — of a small number of lactating women, always in extremely small amounts. ( Two other studies, which did not attempt to concentrate potential mRNA in the samples, were unable to detect any vaccine mRNA.) “It’s also important to note that, although tiny amounts of vaccine mRNA can be detected in some people, this doesn’t necessarily mean that vaccine is present,” Male said in an email. “Another study, that looked for non-mRNA components that would suggest active vaccine was present in breast milk, could not find any, and there is no evidence that this small amount of mRNA could have any negative impact on the health of babies.”"

[/INST]  The state Democratic Party said Gillespie was paid $300,000 \"to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan.\" This, Democrats said, belies Gillespie’s assertion that he’s always opposed mandatory health coverage. There’s no doubt Gillespie was a key adviser to the coalition, as was his business partner. His role was prominently noted in a news release announcing formation of the group, and he spoke on behalf of the group in a radio interview. The group supported an individual mandate, although there’s a bit of hyperbole in the Democrats’ contention it was the ‘centerpiece’ of their agenda. The top item listed on the coalition’s \"core principles\" was bringing market-based efficiency and price transparency to health care. The founder of the coalition says Gillespie privately voiced opposition to a mandate, urged the pursuit of other reforms and never attended the coalition's meetings with politicians. Records show Gillespie’s lobbying firm -- not Gillespie, himself -- was paid $300,000 by the health care coalition in 2007. Gillespie left the firm that June. During the first half of 2007, Gillespie was among 16 people at his firm registered as lobbyists for the coalition. The bulk of the payments came in the second half of 2007, after Gillespie departed. Gillespie’s campaign denies he was paid $300,000, but would not say how much he did pocket.. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Flawed Report Fuels Erroneous Claims About COVID-19 Death Toll\". [/INST] A conservative talk radio host recently told her listeners that because of a change in death certificate procedures specific to COVID-19, “there is a huge chance that COVID death numbers are exaggerated, to the tune of 94%.” That’s false. It’s based on a flawed report whose authors also have penned related claims for an anti-vaccination organization. Wendy Bell, the radio host, made the claim in a March 25 episode of her Pennsylvania-based show. The show was streamed live on Facebook in a video titled, “Has the CDC skewed Covid Fatalities?” It has been viewed more than 34,000 times.  “I’ve reported multiple times that the CDC has said in its own little asterisk, bottom footnote: Of all deaths reported by coroners and health departments to the CDC, only 6% list COVID as the cause of death,” Bell says about 41 minutes into her video. “COVID is what killed this individual — not the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever, and then they got tested in the morgue, but COVID. That 6% number is very significant, and now the CDC is walking it back.” We’re not sure what she means by the “CDC is walking it back.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website still makes note of the statistic that she’s referencing. But the statistic doesn’t mean, as Bell implies, that COVID-19 didn’t actually cause the other deaths. We addressed similar social media posts in September that misrepresented CDC data on COVID-19 deaths. As we wrote, CDC data showed COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on 6% of death certificates, while the other 94% of deaths included other illnesses or conditions, or comorbidities. That’s not unusual since COVID-19 often causes other serious conditions , such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which rank among the most-cited comorbidities for deaths involving COVID-19. L ong-term conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 , such as diabetes or hypertension, are also among the comorbidities listed on death certificates. The CDC notes , however, that 91% of all death certificates mentioning COVID-19 listed it as the underlying cause of death — or the condition that started the chain of events that led to a person’s death. Now, Bell repeats the distortion about the 6% statistic and cites a paper that erroneously suggests the data is inflated because the CDC changed how such deaths are counted, and falsely claims it violated federal law. Reading from a March 19 story in the conservative outlet the Epoch Times , Bell tells her listeners: “ A little-noticed peer-reviewed study published last October by a science and public health journal claims the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ignored federal laws and regulations when it changed how the government counts deaths from COVID-19 , caused by the Wuhan virus.” The paper referenced appeared in a publication called Science, Public Health Policy, and The Law . The publication started in 2019 and is the product of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, an organization run by James Lyons-Weiler. Lyons-Weiler is a scientist with a Ph.D. in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology from the University of Nevada, Reno, who has previously spread false information about COVID-19 vaccines. Most of the paper’s authors also wrote a related post, cited in the report, for Children’s Health Defense, an organization run by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former President John F. Kennedy. We reached out to the report’s lead author, Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon, with some questions about its main points and didn’t receive an on-the-record response. In addition to Bell and the Epoch Times , the paper’s claims have been amplified by other conservative outlets. A February story on the website the National File — headlined “BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law” — was shared more than 16,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . The paper’s authors say that, “[b]ased upon our investigation of Federal Register Records for 2020, there was no formal, transparent, public review process initiated by the NVSS or CDC prior to or following the issuance of the March 24th NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 that dramatically altered cause of death reporting exclusively for COVID-19.” The March 24, 2020, alert being referenced came from the National Vital Statistics System, part of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. It notified the public of a new International Classifications of Diseases code for COVID-19 — since the disease was new, there was no previous code — and offered brief guidance on using it. Days after the March 24 alert, the CDC issued April 2, 2020, guidance explaining more thoroughly how COVID-19 death certificates should be completed. (The agency has issued similar death reporting guidance for other issues, such as for fatalities due to drug toxicity and relating to disaster events.) In short, the paper’s authors argue that the March 24 notice was subject to the Information Quality Act and Paperwork Reduction Act — and therefore should have been publicized in the Federal Register and subject to public comment. But there’s no support for that claim. First of all, we should note that there is no federal law governing death certificate processes. Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, told us in an email that “t he collection of death certificate data is not covered by the [Paperwork Reduction Act],” as the paper suggests. “Death certificate data is collected by the states (i.e., 57 jurisdictions, including 50 states, New York City, District of Columbia and 5 territories), according to state laws and regulations, not according to federal laws or regulations,” he said. “While CDC, i.e., the National Center for Health Statistics, does work with the states to coordinate and promote standardized data collection, along with guidance on some issues such as cause of death certification, NCHS does not (and cannot) impose any legal requirements.” Anderson said that states develop laws and regulations with the standards in mind, and “[o] nce the data are collected by the states, NCHS purchases the data from the states in order to provide national statistics.” Bridget Dooling , a research professor at the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, said that since the collection of death certificate data isn’t subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, the CDC’s March 24 guidance wouldn’t be, either. Dooling — who worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, within the White House Office of Management and Budget, from 2007 to 2018 — also said in a phone interview that the guidance wouldn’t be subject to the Information Quality Act, since those provisions relate to the ways in which government disseminates information. Public health legal experts similarly told our fact-checking colleagues at AFP that the CDC’s guidance didn’t violate federal law. In addition to the claim about the legality of the CDC’s COVID-19 death reporting guidance, the paper’s main contention is that the guidance was a stark departure from the CDC’s guidelines used since 2003. It baselessly suggests that, using the 2003 guidance, COVID-19 fatalities would “be approximately 16.7 times lower than is currently being reported.” “If the fatality data being presented by the CDC is illegally inflated, then all public health policies based upon them would be immediately null and void,” the authors wrote. But the paper misconstrues how death certificates are completed, experts say, and wrongly concludes that a massive change occurred. “The death certification process has not been changed by the CDC,” Dr. James Gill , president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, told us in an email. “I still fill out death certificates the way I have been doing it for over 20 years.” Gill, the chief medical examiner in Connecticut, pointed out that the paper illustrates a misunderstanding of how death certificates are completed. For example, the paper says that Part I of the death certificate “is the immediate cause of death listed in sequential order from the official cause on line item (a) to the underlying causes that contributed to death in descending order of importance on line item (d).” But it’s the most important diagnosis — the underlying cause of death — that is to be listed on the lowest line of Part I, Gill said. The condition immediately preceding death (such as pneumonia) would be listed first and then the illness that caused that condition (COVID-19, for example) would be listed below it. Similarly, Anderson, the chief of the CDC’s mortality statistics branch, said t he “authors of the October paper do not seem to understand how death certificates are designed or how the cause of death should be certified.” A comparison of the 2003 guidelines and the COVID-19 guidance doesn’t reveal any significant change in procedure. “Part I is for reporting a chain of events leading directly to death, with the immediate cause of death (the final disease, injury, or complication directly causing death) on line (a) and the underlying cause of death (the disease or injury that initiated the chain of events that led directly and inevitably to death) on the lowest used line,” the 2003 guidelines say. “Part II is for reporting all other significant diseases, conditions, or injuries that contributed to death but which did not result in the underlying cause of death given in Part I.” And h ere’s how the CDC e xplained the completion of death certificates in its April 2020 guidance specific to COVID-19, beginning with Part I: So it’s not accurate to claim that the CDC’s COVID-19 guidance represented a significant departure from the 2003 guidelines, as the paper repeatedly says. It’s unclear why the authors conclude that, under the 2003 guidelines, COVID-19 would have been “more correctly” included “in Part II as an infection that contributed to death.” The authors also say that the “inclusion of probable fatalities” is indicative that the “data presented is inaccurate.” But the 2003 document, in fact, notes that the cause of death is to be determined according to the best medical opinion — and clearly states: “A condition can be listed as ‘probable’ even if it has not been definitively diagnosed.” And contrary to Bell’s insinuation that fatalities are being deliberately inflated by deaths unrelated to the disease — such as “the tree that they ran into that killed them from blunt force trauma or whatever” — the CDC explicitly advises that COVID-19 not be reported in such cases where the disease didn’t factor into the death. The CDC emphasizes : “COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.” Finally, the paper makes no mention of excess deaths. As we’ve previously explained , excess deaths are deaths above the number expected in a given time period. In the context of COVID-19, it can help assess the true impact of the pandemic by capturing direct and indirect effects of the virus. It can account for unreported COVID-19 deaths and for other factors, such as people dying from other causes (say, avoiding medical attention), as well as drops in other deaths due to pandemic-related restrictions. A New York Times analysis of CDC mortality data shows that, from March 2020 to February 2021, deaths nationwide were about 21% higher than what would have been expected during that time period.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy Is Safe, Has Multiple Benefits\". [/INST] Pregnancy puts people at elevated risk of severe COVID-19. Young babies also are particularly vulnerable to hospitalization from COVID-19. Maternal vaccination reduces these risks. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines come with similar side effects regardless of whether a person is pregnant. Research does not show increased risk of miscarriage , birth defects or other pregnancy complications after vaccination, and it indicates vaccination may reduce the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth . A study published Oct. 23 in JAMA Pediatrics adds to the evidence that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and do not lead to problems for newborn babies and infants when given to their mothers during pregnancy. Going against the now-extensive record on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy, a recent Instagram post claimed that there is “No Discernable Benefit of COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy.” The post was quoting a Substack newsletter from Dr. Peter McCullough, a prolific spreader of vaccine misinformation. The newsletter focused on the new JAMA Pediatrics study on vaccine safety, also claiming that it found “No Assurances on Safety.” “Surely there was no benefit of COVID-19 vaccination, so why expose mothers and infants to any risk at all?” the newsletter misleadingly concluded. We reached out to McCullough with questions but did not receive a response. This contradicts the conclusions of the authors of the paper, who wrote, “Maternal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased adverse newborn and early infant outcomes and may be protective against adverse newborn outcomes.” The study was a safety study and was not meant to assess vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women, co-author Sarah C. J. Jorgensen, a pharmacist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, told us. The researchers aimed to measure whether the babies of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy had any elevated risks of health problems. Jorgensen said the study “does provide more reassuring data on the safety of these vaccines for the newborns and infants.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 6 months and older, including people who are pregnant, receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine . Other medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine , endorse this recommendation. McCullough misused two pieces of raw data from the JAMA Pediatrics study to incorrectly imply that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is unsafe and ineffective. He ignored the primary results of the paper supporting the safety of maternal COVID-19 vaccination for babies, as well as the larger body of data showing maternal COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective. The study used a database, called MOMBABY, that links health records of mothers and babies born in hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Jorgensen and her co-authors based their findings on data from more than 142,000 babies with due dates between May 2021 and early September 2022. The researchers compared babies born to mothers who received at least one mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy with babies whose mothers had never been vaccinated against COVID-19 at all prior to giving birth. McCullough misleadingly referenced unadjusted, or “crude,” data suggesting a very small increased risk of hospital readmission for all causes in newborns up to 4 weeks old born to vaccinated mothers. But the correct statistic to use to determine whether there is a difference in readmissions is the adjusted figure, Victoria Male , a senior lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told us via email. Male was not involved in the study. There are many differences between people who do or do not take COVID-19 vaccines. Well-done studies track characteristics of people in the groups they are comparing so they can adjust for differences, such as whether they live in high-income areas or have a tendency to engage in healthy behaviors. “The adjusted results, after accounting for differences in the characteristics of the different groups, show no increased risk for neonatal readmission between the two groups,” pediatrics and internal medicine specialist Dr. Malini DeSilva and statistician Gabriela Vazquez-Benitez told us in an email. Both researchers, who were not involved in the study, are affiliated with HealthPartners Institute and study vaccine safety in pregnant people. DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez added that the study did not show an increased risk for neonatal readmission with additional COVID-19 vaccine doses received during pregnancy. The study also followed babies through 6 months of age and found a similar rate of hospital readmission regardless of maternal vaccination status. Jorgensen and her co-authors wrote that the slight increased risk of newborn readmission in the crude data could be explained by the elevated rates of death and severe health problems in newborns born to unvaccinated mothers. The sickest babies had either died or had not left the hospital by the age of 4 weeks and therefore could not be readmitted, so these babies were excluded from the hospital readmission analysis. McCullough’s post also fails to highlight the study’s other findings, which indicate no association between the vaccines and negative effects on newborns. “The study finds that outcomes at birth are actually better for babies born following vaccination in pregnancy, and this finding is unchanged when the authors do additional analyses to take account of the fact that vaccinated families tend to have better healthcare in general,” Male said. The improvements for newborns included lower risk of severe problems such as hemorrhage or seizures, neonatal intensive care unit stays, and death. It’s unclear how great of a role vaccines played in causing these lower risks. Maternal vaccination may have helped improve newborn outcomes by mitigating the risks associated with getting COVID-19 during pregnancy. But the authors of the paper wrote this was unlikely to fully explain the risk reductions they saw. DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez said that “healthy vaccinee bias,” in which people who get vaccines tend to be healthier and more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, could help explain the reduced risks of poor newborn health outcomes — despite attempts to adjust for these factors. They also pointed out that people who give birth earlier in their pregnancies will have less opportunity to get vaccinated. Being born too early can lead to health problems for babies. Regardless, the reduced risk means it’s unlikely vaccination increased the risk of NICU stays, severe health problems or deaths in newborns, the researchers concluded. “It is at least reassuring that they are not elevated,” Jorgensen said. McCullough had other critiques of the data used in the study. But he “misunderstands how the MOMBABY database works,” Male said. McCullough incorrectly wrote in his Substack post that if a mother delivered at one hospital and later took her baby to another hospital or clinic “for seizures, hemorrhage, etc.,” the pair wouldn’t be linked. The MOMBABY database captures all hospitalizations in Ontario, Jorgensen said, so admission to any hospital in the province would be recorded and linked to the mother. The study was not meant to capture visits to clinics, which likely would be routine or for more minor issues. Finally, McCullough pointed out that the study did not report on miscarriage or stillbirth. “That’s true: this study was not designed to look into that,” Male said. But other studies have shown no effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the rate of miscarriage. And as we’ve said, vaccination may reduce the risk of stillbirth. McCullough also highlighted data showing similar rates of positive COVID-19 PCR test results during pregnancy among vaccinated and unvaccinated women, seemingly to back up his statement that the vaccines have no benefit during pregnancy. However, the work “wasn’t designed as a study to look at vaccine effectiveness for pregnant women,” Jorgensen said. The data on COVID-19 testing were provided in a table describing characteristics of vaccinated versus unvaccinated pregnant women, which were used to adjust for differences between the groups. Jorgensen, Male, DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez all pointed out that in this study, there wasn’t information on whether the vaccinated women who tested positive for COVID-19 got vaccinated before or after getting sick. “We therefore can’t use this data to tell us anything about the effectiveness of COVID vaccination at preventing infection,” Male said. Studies designed to look at COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness have found that it is similar whether the vaccines are given to pregnant or non-pregnant individuals. In the omicron era, vaccination has provided significant protection against severe disease and more limited protection against symptomatic illness — with booster doses improving effectiveness. Furthermore, people who get vaccinated during pregnancy can pass on antibodies to their babies via the umbilical cord and subsequently via breast milk, although the level of protection provided by the breast milk antibodies is unclear. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 during the first six months of a baby’s life, and particularly during the newborn period, according to multiple studies. For instance, Jorgensen and her colleagues did a different study using the MOMBABY registry on the effects of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on babies during the first six months of life. Babies whose mothers had gotten the original primary vaccine series, including at least one dose during pregnancy, had a 45% lower risk of infection and 53% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron than babies of unvaccinated mothers. Protection was better if the mothers got at least one dose during the third trimester. With a booster dose during pregnancy, protection also increased, with babies having a 73% lower risk of infection and an 80% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron. “Regardless of pregnancy status, COVID-19 vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death,” DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez said. “In addition to reducing the risks of severe illness from COVID-19 in pregnant persons, COVID-19 vaccines administered during pregnancy can provide infants with antibodies against COVID before they are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"mRNA Vaccines Protect Against COVID-19 Mortality, Contrary to Misleading Posts\". [/INST] Both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech , showed excellent results in the clinical trials. There were no serious safety concerns reported for either of them, and both were more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19. With the arrival of new viral variants and the passage of time, the vaccines no longer provide strong protection against mild disease, but many studies have shown that these vaccines work very well in preventing severe COVID-19 and death. One estimate suggests that COVID-19 vaccines prevented more than 3 million deaths in the U.S. Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine , which is designed differently and uses a harmless adenovirus to trigger an immune response, showed a slightly lower efficacy. Although no serious safety issues were detected in the clinical trials, rare cases of a dangerous blood clotting condition combined with low blood platelets known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome were reported in the U.S. shortly after the vaccine was authorized for use. In 2022, the FDA limited its authorization . Now that the last doses expired in May, the vaccine is no longer available in the country. But some social media posts are citing a recent study that reanalyzed data from the original trials to compare the impact of both types of vaccines — the mRNA and adenovirus vector COVID-19 vaccines — on deaths from all causes, to incorrectly imply that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous or have no effect on mortality from COVID-19. “Researchers inadvertently reveal mRNA covid vaccines are NOT ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER MORTALITY in reassessment of Random Control Trials (RCTs),” reads a p o st on Instagram, which also misleadingly implies that the original trial data were interpreted incorrectly. “27 of the 31 deaths in the RCTs that took either Moderna or Pfizer were blood, heart, or artery related, to the shock of no one who’s been paying attention,” the post adds. “COVID Shots Had ZERO Impact on Reducing Deaths, Study Finds,” reads the headline of an item on a conservative website. The posts do not specify overall mortality, leading many viewers to incorrectly assume the vaccines don’t protect against death from COVID-19. Cases of inflammation of the heart muscle or its surrounding tissue, known as myocarditis and pericarditis, have occurred after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination , mostly in young men and after a second dose. But cases are rare and patients usually respond well to medicine and recover quickly. The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have not been linked to any other heart problems. Nor have they been shown to increase the risk of death. Study after study has confirmed the benefits outweigh the small risks. The cited study was published in April in the journal iScience by researchers from Denmark, the Netherlands, and Germany. The authors reanalyzed mortality data reported in the various clinical trials and found that the adenoviral vaccines appeared to reduce death from any cause, while the mRNA vaccines did not. They concluded that the adenoviral vaccines might have some beneficial effects. Scientists have questioned the study since it was posted a year ago as a preprint. At that time, the study was also misinterpreted and used to misleadingly claim mRNA vaccines offer “no mortality benefit” at all, as our colleagues from PolitiFact wrote . The authors have acknowledged the limitations of the study and responded to some critics, but have not explicitly corrected claims stating the vaccines are dangerous or don’t reduce COVID-19 mortality. “It is not possible to say, based on our findings, that ‘mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not effective or harmful,’” Dr. Christine Stabell Benn , the lead author, told us in an email. But Benn, who is a member of a controversial committee gathered by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to advise the state on public health issues, also told us the results from the clinical trials “do not exclude” the possibility that the vaccines “are associated with considerable harm.” As we’ve reported , DeSantis’ committee of contrarian experts held a roundtable in December claiming the COVID-19 vaccines were too risky. The iScience study’s goal was to determine if the COVID-19 vaccines had broad effects on the immune system, beyond the vaccine’s ability to prepare the immune system to better fight off the coronavirus. In particular, the authors wanted to use the available trial data to see if the vaccines had an effect on overall mortality. Two of the authors of the study, Benn and Peter Aaby , both professors at the University of Southern Denmark, have been studying what are called non-specific effects of vaccines, or secondary vaccine effects , for decades. Typically, vaccines targeting a particular disease are not expected to have any effects on other diseases, since the immune system is responding to specific pathogen. But some epidemiology studies suggest that some vaccines may have broader effects. The concept is still understudied and many questions remain, according to a report of a workshop on the topic held by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in July 2021. To study the COVID-19 vaccines’ effects on overall mortality, the researchers counted the deaths reported in the two main mRNA trials and in five trials of three different adenovirus vector vaccines. They then combined the data for each vaccine type and compared it. For the mRNA vaccines, there were a total of 74,193 participants in both the Pfizer/BioNTech and the Moderna trials. Among them, there were 61 deaths: 31 in the vaccine groups and 30 in the placebo groups. Half of the non-COVID-19 deaths (27 of 54) were related to cardiovascular issues, the study found, and the vaccines had no beneficial effect on those deaths, according to the researchers. “There were no obvious benefits for these vaccines beyond preventing COVID mortality, which is not surprising,” said Dr. Peter J. Hotez , dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, after reviewing the study for us. “And we know, for instance, that after vaccines became widely available in the United States, the benefits of mRNA vaccines in terms of preventing mortality from COVID-19 were overwhelming.” In the adenovirus vector vaccines trials included in the study, there were a total of 122,164 participants, with 46 deaths among them: 16 in the vaccine groups, 30 in the placebo groups. Therefore, the researchers concluded, the data suggested these vaccines were associated with a reduction in overall mortality, which they attributed to a lower COVID-19 mortality and a lower cardiovascular mortality (there were no cardiovascular deaths in the vaccine groups and eight in the placebo ones). “The results suggest that adenovirus-vector vaccines compared with placebo have beneficial non-specific effects, reducing the risk of non-COVID-19 diseases. The most important cause of non-COVID-19 death was cardiovascular disease, against which the data for the current RCTs suggest that the adenovirus-vector vaccines provide at least some protection,” researchers said. The authors speculate that the adenovirus vector vaccines “prime the immune system in a way similar to a ‘live’ vaccine,” which is the kind of vaccine that uses weakened virus and has most often been found in their previous studies to have non-specific effects. But to other scientists, these results are being overinterpreted. The data does not allow for a meaningful analysis, they say, since the vaccine trials were not designed to assess mortality and the available data is minimal. “It’s hard to say anything very conclusive,” Hotez, who participated in the NIAID workshop on secondary vaccine effects, told us about the paper. If anything, he said, it can generate a hypothesis that would need much broader testing and research. “The claims about mRNA vaccines, including the purported cardiovascular effects, are based on far too few events to make any realistic conclusions,” Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz , an epidemiologist from the University of Wollongong in Australia, told us in an email. “Moreover, we have an enormous wealth of more recent evidence demonstrating that mRNA vaccines save lives. This particular analysis takes a handful of deaths from very different populations – the mRNA vaccine trials were conducted in a very different patient population to the adenovirus vector vaccine trials – and inappropriately compares them.” He also said it was concerning that the study used trial data for the Sputnik vaccine, a Russian adenovirus COVID-19 vaccine. Meyerowitz-Katz and others have found data inconsistencies with that trial, raising questions about how trustworthy it is. Dr. David R. Boulware , a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School, told us the fact that the trials were held in different locations is very significant. “[T]he adenovirus vaccine trials … were run mostly in low and middle income countries where the overall case fatality rate was 2%. The mortality in the mRNA vaccine trials, mostly run in high-income countries, was 0.3%. Deaths were too few to show any reduction,” he told us in an email. Benn and her team responded to these concerns in May 2022 after the preprint was published, and again in May 2023 . They say the study results should not be dismissed because of the limited data. “Our key message is that yes, data is regrettably limited, but it does show differences in mortality effect between the two major vaccine types that if true would have major global health implications,” Benn wrote on Twitter . Regardless of whether the adenoviral vaccines have beneficial non-specific effects, it’s incorrect to suggest that the mRNA vaccines don’t protect against COVID-19 mortality, or to imply that they’re dangerous.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Targets Gates With Old Clip, Misleading Edit\". [/INST] A Facebook video viewed more than 100,000 times is using a deceptively edited clip of Bill Gates to accuse the Microsoft co-founder of advocating for a nefarious plan to depopulate the world through vaccines. The video — captioned, “ Take a look at this #DepopulationAgenda” — employs a computer-generated voiceover that suggests Gates and other high-profile philanthropists want to remove some portion of the global population. The same video was uploaded to YouTube in April 2020, as misinformation relating to Gates swirled on social media.  The Facebook version includes ominous music and is presented as a meme, adding an apocalyptic image of a syringe in front of a pile of skulls to further imply a deadly plan is afoot. The narration tells viewers it will use quotes directly from “Bill Gates himself so that later no one will accuse me of allegedly distorting his words.” But then it does just that. The video misleadingly edits Gates’ 2010 TED Talk — “ Innovating to zero! ” — which focused on the need to zero out carbon dioxide emissions through new approaches to energy production in order to fight climate change . Ignoring Gates’ theme of energy innovation, the video misleadingly portrays the speech as evidence of a purported “depopulation” agenda that involves COVID-19 and the global vaccination efforts of Gates, the World Health Organization and pharmaceutical companies. Before showing parts of Gates’ 2010 talk, the video presents part of a 2009 story in the Guardian that reported that Gates and other billionaire philanthropists had met and discussed overpopulation as a serious issue facing the world. But that was only one topic discussed. The video ignores that the group reportedly discussed a range of other issues, too — including education, government reform and the economic crisis at that time. It’s also worth noting — since the Facebook video doesn’t — that the same Guardian story also reported that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation vaccination project — Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance — was estimated at the time “to have prevented 3.4 million deaths in just eight years.” After its selective use of the Guardian article, the video then goes on to show a clip from Gates’ 2010 TED Talk as he was discussing the amount of carbon dioxide produced each year around the world. That portion of Gates’ talk has spawned a false narrative that has persisted over the years that argues Gates was calling for the killing of millions of people by using vaccines — a narrative that the Facebook video again revisits. It’s clear, however, that Gates was referring once again to his belief that improving health and reducing child deaths, including through vaccines , can have the effect of limiting future population growth — which he has talked about many other times. In 2012, he again spoke about the need in underdeveloped countries to provide family planning services and better health care to decrease child mortality in order to deal with overpopulation. Similarly, in 2018, Melinda Gates, his wife and co-founder of the couple’s foundation, said : “When more children live past the age of 5, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood.” Bill Gates went on in his full, unedited TED Talk to spend most of his time focusing on the need to drastically reduce carbon dioxide emissions through innovation in energy production. For example, he spoke about one venture he backs that aims to create more efficient nuclear energy by using the waste created by current nuclear reactors. But the video on Facebook cuts all of that — nearly 13 minutes in total — and moves directly from Gates briefly referencing the prospect of limiting population growth rate to his saying it’s his “wish” for such a technology. It provides no context for viewers to understand what hoped-for technology he was referencing. The edited video picks up his talk here: “So what have we heard from Bill?” the video voiceover says. “Global warming — which is supposedly caused by anthropogenic carbon emission — and to reset it, you need to slightly reduce the world’s population.” As we said, Gates briefly suggested that health care and vaccines could reduce the rate at which the population grows — but he didn’t propose killing off humans, as the video implies. His focus in the Ted Talk was on reducing carbon dioxide emissions by transforming the energy sector — something this misleading video leaves on the cutting-room floor. The full TED Talk can be seen here:  The Facebook video continues by showing a 2011 clip of Gates speaking with CNN’s Sanjay Gupta about his pledge to spend $10 billion over a decade on vaccination efforts. He said in the interview that by reducing the number of children who die every year through vaccines, “the benefits there are in terms of reducing sickness, reducing the population growth, it really allows society a chance to take care of itself.” The video presents a loop of Gates saying the words, “reducing the population growth,” and then asks: “Amazing, isn’t it?” Except, as we said, Gates has been transparent about his belief that improved health and vaccines could reduce population growth . The video concludes by sowing doubt about the global response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It presents a lengthy video clip of Gates in 2015 discussing the need for pandemic preparedness — followed by details of Gates’ significant contributions to WHO and his foundation’s participation in a 2019 preparedness exercise involving a coronavirus — to baselessly insinuate that Gates, WHO and the pharmaceutical industry are behind a global effort to kill people. As we’ve explained before, such preparedness exercises have been held for many years. And some experts had warned of the potential for coronaviruses (which are a family of viruses) to trigger a pandemic at least 20 years before the 2019 outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But the video ignores all of that context, instead feeding viewers a narrative that is heavy on innuendo and lacking in evidence. See more of our SciCheck work to learn about COVID-19 and vaccines.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Four False Claims About Monkeypox\". [/INST] Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus related to smallpox, as we’ve explained before . The disease was discovered in lab monkeys in 1958 and can spread from animals to humans, as well as between humans. On Aug. 4, the U.S. declared monkeypox a public health emergency as the number of confirmed cases in the country reached 7,102. Rumors have taken off online since early May, when an outbreak of monkeypox began in countries outside of Central and West Africa, where the disease is endemic. We recently debunked a false claim about its origins. Now, a meme spreading several false claims about the disease has been circulating online with a BBC logo, although no such image is available on BBC websites or social media accounts. We’ll address each of the meme’s inaccurate claims below. Claim: “CDC has now classified this disease as airborne and anybody within 15 ft can catch it” Facts: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has explained that monkeypox spreads through “close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact” with an infected person. That includes direct contact with an infected person’s sores or body fluids, contact with fabric or surfaces that have been used by someone who has monkeypox, and contact with infected “respiratory secretions.” As we’ve explained before , monkeypox can spread through respiratory droplets, probably because lesions in the mouth make saliva infectious. But those larger droplets only travel a few feet — far short of the 15 feet claimed in the meme. So this type of infection would require extended face-to-face contact. The CDC has also noted that scientists are still researching how often the virus is spread by respiratory secretions. Such spread doesn’t make the virus “airborne.” As the CDC explains : “Airborne transmission occurs when small virus particles become suspended in the air and can stay there for periods of time” or even “spread on air currents.” But monkeypox “may be found in droplets like saliva or respiratory secretions that drop out of the air quickly. Long range (e.g., airborne) transmission of monkeypox has not been reported.” Claim: “This disease is now classified as a form of herpes” Facts: Monkeypox is in the Poxviridae family of viruses, which includes the virus that causes the more severe disease of smallpox. Interestingly — and perhaps what led to the falsehood in the meme — despite its name, chickenpox is not caused by a virus in the Poxviridae family. Instead, it’s caused by varicella-zoster , which is in the Herpesviridae family of viruses, which includes herpes simplexes 1 and 2. Put simply, monkeypox is a poxvirus , not a herpesvirus . Claim: “The illness typically last 2-4 months. If you have symptoms avoid going outside” Facts: Monkeypox typically lasts between two and four weeks, according to the CDC , not “2-4 months,” as the meme claims. “In most cases, the symptoms of monkeypox go away on their own within a few weeks,” the World Health Organization has explained . “However, in some people, an infection can lead to medical complications and even death. Newborn babies, children and people with underlying immune deficiencies may be at risk of more serious symptoms and death from monkeypox.” Claim: “Monkeypox can lead to being paralyzed” Facts: According to the WHO , the most common symptoms of monkeypox include “fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes.” Additionally, monkeypox typically causes a rash or lesions that begin flat, then fill with liquid before crusting over and falling off. The CDC has described a similar set of symptoms . Neither organization included paralysis in the list of symptoms, and we could find no evidence that paralysis has been a recognized problem associated with monkeypox. This claim may have come from conflating monkeypox with another viral illness that’s been in the headlines recently — polio.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Post Comes to Premature Conclusions About COVID-19 Omicron Variant Severity\". [/INST] Since the discovery in late November of a new, highly mutated version of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, scientists have been scrambling to learn more about it. First reported to the World Health Organization by South Africa on Nov. 24, the omicron variant has sparked concern across the globe because of fears that it might be able to evade immunity and be more transmissible than the already highly contagious delta variant. As we’ve reported , the omicron variant contains a worrying set of mutations, some of which are predicted to aid in viral transmission or get around protective neutralizing antibodies. In addition, the variant is spreading quickly in South Africa. While more information is coming in every day, major questions remain, including how transmissible the virus is and how severe its infections are. Some early evidence suggests omicron cases may be less severe compared with other variants, but it’s too soon to know for sure. Despite the uncertainty, a popular Facebook post baselessly claims omicron is especially virulent. “Be sure to wear a mask, because the new COVID-Omicron variant coronavirus is different, deadly and not easy to detect correctly,” the post misleadingly reads, before going on to list symptoms it claims are of the variant. “Of course, the toxicity of COVID-Omicron is 5 times higher than that of the Delta variant, and the mortality rate is also higher than that of Delta,” the post continues, adding that omicron is “highly harmful, the virus is highly virulent, and the fatal rate is high.” It also states, without evidence, that the omicron “wave … is more deadly than the first wave of Covid-19.” As we’ve explained before , ​​it’s still too early to tell if the omicron variant is more or less virulent than delta, let alone to put a quantitative estimate on it — and any accurate assessment of severity will take some time. But there are some signs that omicron infections might be less severe. Dr. Angelique Coetzee , chair of the South African Medical Association, and a physician who has been treating some of the early omicron cases in that country, has told multiple news outlets that omicron cases so far appear to be very mild, with an unusual presentation that is mostly limited to extreme fatigue, body aches and pains, and headache. Some of her comments, including the idea that patients do not seem to have a severe cough, may be the origin of some of the symptoms listed in the post. It’s hard to know, though, whether this is fully representative or will change in the future. As of Nov. 28, the WHO has said that there “is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants.” According to a Dec. 4 report on the first set of likely omicron cases at Steve Biko/Tshwane District Hospital Complex in Pretoria, South Africa, fewer patients have needed supplemental oxygen than before, and more cases are what physicians there are calling “incidental” cases, or instances of COVID-19 that were detected in people who were found to be infected when they underwent the required testing for hospital admission, but were admitted for another reason. The overall in-hospital death rate is also lower — 6.6%, over the past two weeks, compared with 17% over the past 18 months. “It’s too early to be able to determine the precise severity of disease,” Dr. Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained in a Dec. 7 coronavirus briefing , in reviewing the existing evidence on the topic. “But it appears that with the cases that are seen, we are not seeing a very severe profile of disease.” “It might be — and I underscore might — be less severe, as shown by the ratio of hospitalizations per number of new cases,” he continued. “However, this could be influenced by the fact that many in this particular cohort are young individuals. The hospital stay seems to be less and the use of supplemental oxygen needs to be less. Again, I caution you. These are still preliminary.” Because hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators, Fauci said, it would likely take “at least another couple of weeks” before scientists have a “good handle” on the relative severity of omicron, and “a few weeks thereafter” to have a “really good handle” on the subject. Another issue making it difficult to tell whether the apparently less severe cases truly reflect a drop in the virus’s virulence is COVID-19 immunity in the population, either from previous infection or vaccines. South Africa has a relatively low vaccination rate, but some experts estimate that almost all South Africans have already had COVID-19. If that’s the case, then it could well be that the reduced severity reflects the fact that most people are already largely protected from severe disease, even if they are susceptible to reinfection with this variant. The Facebook post also baselessly claims that the omicron variant is “not easy to detect correctly” and suggests that cases of the variant are difficult to diagnose with current tests. “The result of nasal swab test for COVID-Omicron is usually negative, and the number of false negative cases of nasopharyngeal test is increasing,” the post reads. There is no evidence that the omicron variant is causing COVID-19 tests to fail on any large scale. Dozens of countries around the world have been able to identify omicron infections by sequencing the viruses present in specimens that have tested positive with existing diagnostic tests. “The widely used PCR tests continue to detect infection, including infection with Omicron,” the World Health Organization said in its Nov. 28 update on the variant, referring to polymerase chain reaction tests that check patient samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that one particular PCR test authorized and used in the U.S. is expected to be unable to detect the omicron variant, since the test only looks for one short stretch of the viral sequence, and omicron happens to have a deletion in that spot. But the test is just one of many available molecular tests — the agency has authorized 267, as of Dec. 9 — and is not thought to be used for high-volume testing. (The FDA identified one other authorized PCR test that would be affected, but it hasn’t been distributed to anyone.) PCR tests that check for other parts of the viral genome or at multiple different spots are not expected to have problems identifying omicron infections. As we have explained before , many omicron viruses have a deletion in the S, or spike, gene, that affects a few popular PCR tests. But it’s turning out to be a feature rather than a bug. Because of the deletion, many omicron samples won’t test positive for the S gene — unlike with most delta samples — but are positive for the other two gene targets. This means the test still works to diagnose omicron patients, while at the same time flagging potential omicron cases. As the WHO writes in its Dec. 7 weekly epidemiological update , this “S-gene target failure (SGTF) can be used as a marker suggestive of Omicron,” although the agency says sequencing should be done to confirm that, since other variants are known to have the deletion. While evaluations are continuing, there is also no evidence to indicate that more rapid but less sensitive antigen tests , which look for the presence of viral proteins in a sample, are unable to detect omicron infections. The WHO’s update notes that preliminary evidence from labs “independently confirms” that antigen tests can accurately diagnose omicron infections, and that as of Dec. 7, “there have been no reported misdiagnoses (false negative results)” for any WHO-authorized diagnostic test because of the omicron variant. South Africa’s Coetzee, in her interview with Canada’s Global News, also said that antigen tests were “definitely” still working against omicron, although she cautioned against testing too soon once symptoms develop. While much of the post is unsubstantiated, particularly its claims about disease severity, it urges readers to be cautious of the new variant. “Please be careful, avoid crowded places, keep a distance of 1.5m even in open places, wear a double-layer mask, wear suitable masks, and wash your hands frequently when everyone has no symptoms (coughing or sneezing),” the post reads. Those are all recommended precautions that public health officials are emphasizing to protect people from both omicron and the still-dominant delta, so that’s good advice. It’s worth noting that even if omicron infection results in less severe disease, if it’s more transmissible, it could still end up hurting more people. “If they’re allowed to spread unchecked, even though they’re not individually more virulent or lethal, they just generate more cases, they put pressure on the health system and more people die,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said of coronavirus variants during a Dec. 8 press conference . The post, however, doesn’t mention vaccination, which is the single best way to protect yourself against COVID-19. “The single big message, if you are offered a vaccine, please get that vaccine,” said Ryan. “It doesn’t matter what variant you’re doing it for.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"CDC Document Discusses Strategy To Protect Displaced People From COVID-19\". [/INST] Last year, the CDC posted a document on its website reviewing the so-called shielding approach for limiting the number of severe COVID-19 cases in “humanitarian settings,” such as camps for displaced people. In such a strategy, individuals at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions, would be separated from the general population of the camp in an effort to protect them from becoming infected with the novel coronavirus. The CDC document, which is titled “Interim Operational Considerations for Implementing the Shielding Approach to Prevent COVID-19 Infections in Humanitarian Settings,” does not endorse the strategy, but instead explains the rationale and raises several potential concerns with it. But conservatives, including the popular commentator Candace Owens, have misconstrued the text of the document to falsely claim that the agency is considering putting high-risk Americans into camps. “Holy shit. The CDC actually put together a document to discuss putting high risk people into camps to ‘shield’ low risk people from them,” she wrote in an Aug. 9 tweet , linking to the CDC’s page. “No— this is not a joke, and yes, every single person who has made a reference to 1930’s Germany is vindicated,” Owens added. Her tweet was subsequently shared by multiple users on Instagram and Facebook . “I hope everyone realizes the CDC has discussed putting people in camps to separate them from the low risk population. Hello Nazi Germany!” one repost on Facebook reads . “It’s like they aren’t even trying to hide this stuff anymore.” Owens has previously been the subject of numerous fact- checking articles from us and others , including stories about COVID-19. Other groups have also spread the false claim, including the conservative news outlet the Epoch Times . “The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention detailed in a July 26 report the options for creating camps to isolate Americans amid the COVID-19 outbreak,” the media group incorrectly stated in an Instagram post promoting its Aug. 10 live Q&A. That post is accompanied by a photo of two health care workers wearing masks and American flag head coverings, emblazoned with the question, “CDC Virus Camps?” There in fact are no “CDC Virus Camps,” nor did the agency ever propose such a thing. The document, moreover, is from July 26 of last year, during the Trump administration. Jade Fulce, a CDC public affairs specialist, told us the agency document was specific to “humanitarian settings” and was created in response to a March 2020 paper from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which advised using the shielding approach “in camps and camp-like settings for refugees and internally displaced persons” to reduce the burden of COVID-19. That paper, which notes that “forcibly displaced populations … may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 epidemics due to overcrowding, poor access to safe water and sanitation and limited access to health services,” describes creating temporary “green zones” for vulnerable individuals to “limit, if not completely eliminate, contacts that may result in transmission … between high-risk and low-risk people.” The CDC document explains that its purpose is to “highlight potential implementation challenges of the shielding approach from CDC’s perspective and guide thinking around implementation in the absence of empirical data,” since the ideas in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine paper have not been tested. “In theory, shielding may serve its objective to protect high-risk populations from disease and death,” the CDC document reads . “However, implementation of the approach necessitates strict adherence to protocol. Inadvertent introduction of the virus into a green zone may result in rapid transmission among the most vulnerable populations the approach is trying to protect.” Far from endorsing the strategy, the agency details multiple logistical and ethical problems with shielding, as proposed in the U.K. paper. The paper, for example, suggests that high-risk people clean their own spaces, but the CDC notes that could be challenging if those individuals have disabilities or can’t move around easily. Similarly, on the recommendation that each green zone have a dedicated bathroom for high-risk people, the agency notes that the paper also advises not initiating any new construction, but that there are unlikely to be enough preexisting facilities. The CDC also raises the concern that more people than expected in displacement camps might be considered higher risk, further complicating the execution of the approach; that camps might need to continue the strategy for a prolonged time; and that shielding might have negative psychological impacts that could worsen mental health, among others. Fulce explained that the CDC weighed in on the shielding strategy because the agency sees it as part of its job for its global response to the pandemic. “One way in which we support global partners is through interpretation and analysis of new data and science related to COVID-19,” she said. “CDC has identified several limitations on the use and impact of shielding on the overall well-being and mental health of communities asked to adopt it. Shielding may involve ethical issues that could be difficult to address,” Fulce added. “CDC advises careful review of these limitations and ethical issues before considering the use of shielding to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This review can help avoid negative consequences that could occur with the use of shielding.” Claims suggesting that the CDC is planning to isolate high-risk Americans are therefore entirely bogus. Not only does the document only apply to displaced people, but the agency is lukewarm on the strategy at best, primarily highlighting the challenges and risks of the shielding approach for places that are deciding whether to adopt it.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Fox News Commentator Had Aggressive Cancer Before COVID-19 Vaccines Were Available\". [/INST] Studies have shown that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna are very effective in preventing severe cases of the disease and death , saving millions of lives across the world. Clinical trials involving thousands of people, numerous studies and close monitoring of hundreds of millions of doses have found the vaccines to be safe. As we’ve written , serious side effects are rare. Despite the evidence, a growing number of people have become skeptical of the effectiveness of the vaccines and believe false conspiracy theories that they are killing large numbers of people . There is no evidence supporting a link between the COVID-19 vaccine and cancer, as we’ve reported . Both the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society have said there’s no information suggesting the vaccines cause cancer, make it more aggressive, or lead to a recurrence of cancer. But vaccine opponents have tried to make that connection, claiming vaccines can cause a particularly fast-growing cancer, coining the term “turbo cancer” to describe the supposed phenomenon. It is not backed by evidence, as we’ve reported . After Dr. Kelly Powers died on Dec. 4 at age 45, posts on Facebook and Instagram baselessly suggested her cancer was caused or worsened by the COVID-19 vaccine. Powers, a podiatric surgeon and health commentator for Fox News and Fox Business, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in July 2020, months before the vaccines were first distributed in the U.S. in December 2020 . Posts on Facebook and Instagram included a screenshot of a headline from a Dec. 4 article by the People’s Voice , a website that often publishes vaccine misinformation . The headline read: “Fully Vaccinated Fox News Doctor Kelly Powers, Who Survived On-Air Heart Attack, Dies From Turbo Cancer.” A Dec. 4 Instagram post, which shared a screenshot of the headline, wrote: “But probably not related, right?” Another Facebook post shared a screenshot of a different article from the People’s Voice, headlined: “Scientists Warn Turbo Cancer That Killed Kelly Powers Will Soon ‘Spread Like Wildfire’ Among General Population.” “Terrible: Scientists have predicted that the vaccinated population will soon see a sharp rise in turbo cancer diagnoses in the next few years,” the post read. “Experts are worried there will be more cases like Dr Powers in the coming decades because glioblastomas are on the rise among all age groups. Diagnoses are expected to rise by up to 75 percent by 2050.” While COVID-19 vaccines can cause minor and short-lived side effects , such as fatigue and soreness at the injection site, there is no evidence that the vaccines cause cancer or worsen cancer in people who already have it. Vaccine opponents point to some studies they claim show such a link. For instance, social media posts, including an April 16 Facebook post by America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that has repeatedly spread misinformation about the pandemic, has highlighted a review article published in the International Journal of Biological Macromolecules to claim that “COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could aid cancer development.” But the review paper, as we’ve written, was based on other published articles and did not contain original research. Experts told us that the review misinterpreted several studies about the role of a particular mRNA modification used in the mRNA vaccines. There is no evidence the modification increases cancer growth. Posts in 2023 made similar false claims, citing a study that they said “proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer.” The posts claimed that a mouse in the study “died suddenly,” echoing incorrect beliefs that large groups of people have died from the vaccine. However, one of the co-authors of the study in question told us their case report had been misinterpreted. The 2023 study , published in Frontiers in Oncology, described a single mouse that died from lymphoma out of 14 mice that were given a high-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine injected directly into a vein. That’s not the method used to give vaccines to people, and the study did not actually show the mouse’s blood cancer was related to the vaccine. The authors later published an addendum to their paper noting that after injecting more than 70 mice, they only ever observed the one mouse with any kind of blood cancer. They also emphasized that as a case report, their study did not establish a causal link between vaccination and cancer nor did it in any way change the vaccine’s “overwhelming benefit-risk profile.” They added that they wished to “unequivocally disassociate” themselves from the made-up term of “turbo cancer.” The type of brain cancer that Powers had is rare and difficult to treat, and there is little known about what causes it, as we’ve reported . Glioblastoma is a stage 4 brain cancer and is inherently aggressive. As the Glioblastoma Foundation explains , it’s an invasive and fast-growing cancer with a poor prognosis. With treatment, the median survival is about 15 months , according to the foundation, although women and younger patients typically live longer . A GoFundMe fundraiser for Powers created in June notes that she was diagnosed “with one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer” and explains that her cancer returned this year after “three brain surgeries, multiple rounds of radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.” COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with cancer. “Some people with cancer are at increased risk of serious illness if they get COVID-19, because their immune systems have been weakened by the cancer and/or its treatments,” the American Cancer Society explains on its website. Vaccination is one of the most important ways of reducing a person’s risk."

[/INST] Kathy Funk, who was up for reelection as a town clerk in Michigan, in 2020, took a plea deal in a case accusing her of hampering the recount in her primary. Funk was the clerk in the Township of Flint — which is next to , but separate from , the City of Flint , which garnered national attention in 2015 for its lead water crisis . She had won the Democratic primary for that August 2020 race by 79 votes . Prosecutors accused her of breaking the seal on a canister of election ballots so that they couldn’t be recounted. In January 2023, Funk pleaded no contest to one count of misconduct in office, which means that she accepted the punishment but didn’t admit guilt. The punishment , in this case, was two years of probation and six months of house arrest. Prosecutors dropped a charge of ballot tampering. Funk’s primary election in August 2020 was not related to the general election in November or the Michigan presidential primary , which was held on March 10, 2020. But the Epoch Times, a conservative publication with a history of spreading misinformation, has posted a video on social media suggesting that this case — which received news coverage when it was resolved a year ago — is new. The video also vaguely refers to Funk’s crime “during the 2020 election cycle,” leaving some viewers to wrongly conclude her actions affected the 2020 presidential election. A shorter, promotional video for the full five-minute video doesn’t identify Funk — who had left her job as clerk in 2021 to become the elections supervisor for Genesee County. She was placed on administrative leave from her county job when criminal charges were filed against her, and she was terminated in late 2022. The promotional video uses vague language, saying only, “A woman who was both a county election official as well as a former township clerk, she was convicted of tampering with ballots during the 2020 election cycle.” It goes on to say, “Specifically during a recount process, this woman, using her official access, spoiled a batch of ballots in order to make them ineligible to be recounted.” Posts on social media sharing links to the video falsely suggested that Funk’s behavior impacted the 2020 presidential election, a claim that contributes to the ongoing false narrative that the election was “stolen” from former President Donald Trump, who is a primary proponent of this falsehood. One post on Facebook, for example, said, “TRUMP WAS RIGHT Election Official busted for rigging the 2020 election!!” The page that shared the post is run by a Minnesota-based marketing company called Making Web, which runs conservative digital properties — including a website called Trending Politics that has published false claims we’ve written about before and a website that sells pro-Trump merchandise, such as a flag with the slogan, “make votes count again.” Another Facebook post said, “RIGGED FROM THE START Election Official busted for rigging the 2020 election!!” Both of those posts linked to the Epoch Times’ video hosted on the outlet’s website, which requires users to sign in to watch. The title of the video says only, “Former Election Official Convicted for Ballot Tampering.” The full video gives more details, including Funk’s name and the fact that her case involved only her own primary election. But the comments on the Epoch Times’ video and the social media posts indicate that the details were lost on users, many of whom expressed anger at the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. President Joe Biden won that election with 306 electoral votes, compared with 232 for Trump, according to the Federal Election Commission . Biden also won the popular vote, 51% to 47%. But the false narrative that the election was stolen has persisted, and claims like the ones made in social media posts about Funk contribute to its longevity."

[/INST] Nobody by the name of Jonathan Willis is employed by the U.S. Secret Service, agency spokesman Nate Herring told us via email. But in the chaotic hours following the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, an online post by an anonymous user who claimed to be “Jonathan Willis” began fueling nascent conspiracies about the shooting. It said , “My name is Jonathan Willis, I’m the officer in the famous photo of the two snipers on the roof at Trump’s rally. I came here to inform the public that I had the assassin in my sights for at least 3 minutes, but the head of the secret service refused to give the order to take out the perp. 100% the top brass prevented me from killing the assassin before he took the shots at president Trump.” The post, which originated on 4Chan — the anonymous forum best known for incubating the QAnon conspiracy theory — went up about eight hours after the shooting , when concrete information about the incident was scarce. About 20 minutes later, the same anonymous user posted this message : “I didn’t follow the orders though, as soon as the shooter opened on Trump I returned fire despite strict orders to not engage. I had eyes on the shooter for three minutes watching him fiddle with his rifle and adjust the scope, it was obvious he was a shooter yet I wasn’t allowed to engage. After I killed the shooter I was arrested, questioned by the FBI, and just released an hour ago. Already lost my job for not following orders, but I’m glad I took the shots anyway.” Screenshots of those posts quickly migrated to other social media platforms. One such post that has garnered more than 11 million views on X, for example, shared the 4Chan post with the message, “Big if true.” The same X account shared a video from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and quoted Jones as saying of the Secret Service response to the shooting, “That is not a failure of security; that is a stand down.” Similar posts have spread across other major social media platforms, too, including Facebook , TikTok and Instagram . Commenters on those posts have said things such as , “I smell a government cover up that failed and is out in the open!!!” Another called for the director of the Secret Service to be “charged for Treason.” But, as we said, the claims made on 4Chan were posted by an anonymous user, and the Secret Service doesn’t have any employees by the name of Jonathan Willis. Herring, the Secret Service spokesman, told us, “This claim is categorically false.” Secret Service snipers killed the shooter at the scene, and the FBI later identified him as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania. Three attendees were also shot — Corey Comperatore, 50, died, and David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74, were injured."

[/INST] Measures adopted to slow the spread of COVID-19 — such as wearing masks, keeping six feet apart, washing hands frequently and staying home — also slowed the spread of viruses that cause the flu. That’s likely the reason that recorded cases of influenza dropped dramatically in 2020 and 2021, as explained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the World Health Organization , and many other researchers and scientists . The flu is caused by influenza viruses that spread mostly through respiratory droplets, similar to the way the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads . Since the 2012-2013 flu season, the average number of flu cases in the U.S. has been around 30 million each year with roughly about 40,000 deaths, according to the CDC , which did not give estimates for the 2020-2021 season because of the low rates of infection. But a post has gone viral on social media showing a graph from the WHO that demonstrates the dip in cases of the flu. The post includes text that references a well-worn but false claim that COVID-19 was a hoax, saying, “One of the greatest mysteries of COVID-19: Where did the flu go in 2020 and 2021?” Social media users responded with comments such as, “Pretty much they repackaged that year’s flu strain as the rona & took away your civil liberties & destroyed the lives and businesses of thousands, if not millions of people.” The post originated on Twitter , where it has amassed more than 7 million views, according to the site, and elicited a comment — “good question” — from Twitter CEO Elon Musk. It then spread as a screenshot meme to other platforms, including Facebook and Instagram , where it generated such inaccurate comments as “COVID is basically the influenza Flu.” We’ve already addressed similar claims that have spun the falsehood that cases of the flu were wrongly counted as or confused with COVID-19. A WHO spokesperson told us in an email on April 12 that the current claim is also “not accurate,” adding, “the surveillance systems/testing for the two are entirely different.” That’s because the flu and COVID-19 are different illnesses caused by different viruses. As we said, the flu is caused by various types of influenza viruses . COVID-19, however, is caused by a specific type of coronavirus that was first identified at the end of 2019 — SARS-CoV-2 . That virus spreads more easily than viruses that cause the flu, and COVID-19 has killed 1.1 million people in the U.S. since it emerged just over three years ago, which dwarfs the annual average of roughly 40,000 killed by the flu. COVID-19 killed more than 260,000 people in the U.S. in 2022, according to the CDC . In 2021 it killed more than 470,000 and in 2020 it killed more than 354,000, making it the third-leading cause of death in both years — behind heart disease and cancer — according to the National Institutes of Health. It’s likely to be the third leading cause of death again in 2022, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation , although official figures haven’t yet been released. The WHO spokesperson also reiterated the point that’s been made widely by public health organizations and scientists for years: “One of the postulated reasons for the low levels of influenza activity was the effect of lockdowns and travel restrictions during that period.” In fact, the level of recorded influenza cases for one strain of flu virus was so low in that period that researchers thought it may have disappeared entirely. So, it’s wrong to suggest that the dip in recorded cases of the flu during the pandemic is a mystery or that COVID-19 is a hoax. The reduction in flu cases isn’t a mystery, and it’s been explained as the result of widely adopted measures that affect the spread of viruses."

[/INST] Update, Aug. 27, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older. More than 565,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S., but two effective mRNA vaccines are now available. Some treatments for certain patients, such as those hospitalized or receiving oxygen, have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies, and they continue to be studied. Since the pandemic began, however, politicized social media posts have featured doctors, some looking authoritative in white coats, spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The most recent example in this misinformation niche is Dr. Ryan Cole, who owns a medical lab in Idaho. Cole is featured in a video that has amassed more than a million views . He makes a variety of claims, some of which we’ve addressed before. The video was recorded while he spoke at a forum on March 4 hosted by Idaho’s lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, a Republican, and it was posted by a Libertarian organization called the Idaho Freedom Foundation. McGeachin was featured in an October post by that group, posing with a Bible and a gun in a video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign a statement saying that “any order issued in the future will be ignored.” Cole said in an interview with FactCheck.org that he’s “not affiliated with any political party, group or organization.” According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s office, Cole is registered as a Republican. In the March 4 video, Cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously, as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments. We’ll address his four main claims. Two of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. use messenger RNA, or mRNA , to train recipients’ immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes COVID-19. ( See SciCheck’s articles on those vaccines: “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine “ and “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine .”) These are the first vaccines using mRNA technology authorized in the U.S., but scientists have been developing and testing mRNA vaccines for years, including in people during clinical trials. Still, misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online . To those bogus claims, Cole has now added: “mRNA trials in mammals have led to odd cancers. mRNA trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases — not right away, six, nine, 12 months later.” We asked Cole to provide support for those claims, and he referred us to a 2018 paper published in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery that reviewed trials and studies of various, earlier mRNA vaccines. But that paper doesn’t support his statement. Norbert Pardi , a research assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, was the lead author of the paper. He told us in an email, “No publications demonstrate that mRNA vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases.” Pardi’s 19-page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases, which is what Cole highlighted to us. The paper says: “A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken.” But, Pardi explained, he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns. However, he emphasized that “no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real.” It’s also worth noting that the paper predated the COVID-19 pandemic by two years, so it doesn’t include any information specifically about the COVID-19 vaccines. Simply put, “there is no scientific evidence that shows that mRNA vaccines cause autoimmune diseases,” Pardi said. “Multiple clinical trials have been performed with mRNA vaccines in the past 10 years and none of them found that mRNA vaccination caused autoimmune diseases. Further, we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as Dr. Cole inaccurately suggests.” Likewise, Dr. Roger Shapiro , associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support Cole’s claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic. “There is nothing in the science of mRNA vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity, and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before COVID-19,” Shapiro said. “mRNA rapidly breaks down in the body, and probably does not last long enough to act as a carcinogen.” “Regarding autoimmunity,” he said, “this is always a concern with any medical product, but there is no evidence to date suggesting it, and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines. mRNA is made all the time in our bodies, and delivering it by vaccine should not be different.” Dr. Dean Winslow , an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke. In a phone interview, he characterized Cole’s claims about cancer as “fearmongering” and said, “There’s just no scientific basis for that.” “We’re talking about these very small fragments of messenger RNA that don’t hang around for long at all,” he said, noting that the mRNA vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been “very safe, very well-tolerated vaccines.” Winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mRNA from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long-term effects. So he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of RNA, which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Pardi told us, “COVID-19 mRNA vaccines do not alter our DNA and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation.” Cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed a treatment for COVID-19 in order to “vend” a vaccine. (We’ll address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section.) “If there’s a treatment for a disease, the federal government cannot approve a vaccine by law, by rule,” Cole falsely claimed, suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to a treatment for COVID-19 so that they could instead profit from vaccines. “So, the NIH, who, you know, is involved in approving medications, they co-hold the patent on the ‘vaccine’ with Moderna,” Cole said, referring to the National Institutes of Health, an agency that does not approve medications. “If the fox is not guarding the henhouse there, I don’t know who is. That also is insanity to have the government in bed with a private company vending a product that they want to give to everybody.” There are several problems with this statement. First, there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for a given disease, said Jorge Contreras , a professor in the College of Law at the University of Utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law. He asked, “Why would there be such a law?” Clearly there isn’t, Contreras pointed out, since the Food and Drug Administration authorizes a flu vaccine every year while Tamiflu , an antiviral drug used to treat the flu, has been available since the FDA approved it in 1999. “It’s certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for, there is no known cure for,” he said, noting that this is often the case with viral diseases, which are hard to treat. “But that’s not a legal requirement. That’s a scientific reality,” he said. As for Cole’s claim about the NIH, that agency conducts and funds research . It doesn’t approve drugs, medical devices or vaccines — that’s a function of the FDA. The NIH did collaborate with Moderna on the development of its COVID-19 vaccine. As we’ve explained , government researchers had previously been working with scientists at Moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. The team was able to apply that knowledge to design a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the NIH does research, it also files and receives patents , many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies. So, Contreras said, NIH’s patents stemming from research on mRNA vaccines are to be expected, and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected. Similarly, scientists from government-funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs. That’s normal, too, Contreras said. Generally, he explained, there are two reasons that the NIH licenses its patents to companies. First, the NIH is a taxpayer-funded institution, and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries. Second, the clinical trials required to bring a drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive, so, theoretically, making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products. So, Cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the NIH and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that it’s a “conflict of interest” to have the “federal government in bed with a vaccine company.” It’s actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government-owned patents. And he’s wrong when he says of federal agencies, “they don’t want a therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine.” There’s nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for COVID-19. Neither the World Health Organization nor the National Institutes of Health has recommended the use of ivermectin — a common anti-parasitic medication — in the treatment of COVID-19. Merck, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin, has similarly noted that there is “[n]o scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies; No meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease, and; A concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies.” But Cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is a “treatment” for COVID-19. He suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines, as we explained above. “We’re in farm country, horse country — you know, you give it to your dogs, your cats, your horses,” Cole said in the video, addressing an audience in Idaho. Ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals, but crossover use in humans can be dangerous. While Cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug, not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine, the FDA has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for COVID-19 has grown. Ivermectin does have antiviral properties, but the FDA hasn’t approved it to treat any viral infections. It is being studied with regard to COVID-19, though, according to both the WHO and NIH. “Treating COVID-19 with Ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials, but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use,” said Shapiro, the Harvard professor. “My understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems.” The trials so far have “showed no benefit or worsening disease, some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance, and some did show a possible mortality benefit; but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases,” he said. Winslow, from Stanford, cautioned that “there have been many claims for miracle cures” over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating COVID-19. “Ivermectin truly is a wonder drug for parasitic diseases,” he said, “but my suspicion is that it will be a lot like hydroxychloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19, although studies found that it wasn’t an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients, as we’ve explained before. The problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, which are promoted as having broad-spectrum antiviral properties, is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells, Winslow said. Even potent versions, like remdesivir , which Winslow referred to as the “gold standard” of specific antiviral therapy in COVID-19 treatments, only accelerates the time to recovery, but doesn’t significantly reduce death rates or mortality from COVID-19. Remdesivir is the only drug approved by the FDA to treat COVID-19; the approval is for patients requiring hospitalization. So, Cole’s claim that “there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in Washington who have suppressed this life-saving medication,” is unfounded. Ivermectin hasn’t been proved to be effective. Another of the major points that Cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin D could have in fighting COVID-19. “If you do not supplement with vitamin D in the wintertime, you are immune suppressed. Most insurance companies in Idaho and northern states do not pay for a vitamin D test, unfortunately,” said Cole, whose lab offers several vitamin D tests. After eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus, Cole said, “What should public health message number one, two, and three be? Vitamin D, vitamin D, vitamin D.” It’s true that vitamin D, which is mostly associated with bone health, plays a part in the immune system. But that doesn’t mean it’s a panacea for COVID-19, as we’ve explained before . W hile a lot of basic research points to vitamin D having a role in the immune system, it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit COVID-19 patients, as we’ve written. Studies assessing whether vitamin D can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally been inconsistent . A recent article from NPR looked at the research on vitamin D with respect to COVID-19 over the last year and found, essentially, the same thing. It also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin D levels are associated with a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or with becoming seriously ill . “While these studies raised hopes among some researchers, others are skeptical, noting that most of these are observational studies, not the gold-standard randomized, controlled trials,” the story said. “Much of the available evidence only shows association — not causation — and even those results are mixed,” Walter Willett, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told NPR. In September, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an Instagram Live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin D, “I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.” But, as we wrote before, excessive doses should not be used.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts, Pundits Distort Fauci Emails\". [/INST] The Washington Post and BuzzFeed News each filed Freedom of Information Act requests for Dr. Anthony Fauci’s emails and published that correspondence on June 1, showing how the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases navigated the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The batch of emails requested by the Post were from March and April 2020, while BuzzFeed News’ spanned January to June 2020. BuzzFeed News also posted all of the 3,234 pages of the emails it got on a separate site. Conservative pundits and viral social media posts have now mischaracterized some of those emails in an effort to discredit Fauci. We’ll look at three issues: what Fauci was told about the origins of the coronavirus, what he knew about the drug hydroxychloroquine and what he said about the use of face masks. Social media posts and a conservative TV host have highlighted one email to Fauci from Kristian G. Andersen , a professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research. Andersen has studied the origins of SARS-CoV-2. The posts and commentary point to the Jan. 31, 2020, email as proof that “Fauci knew the virus was likely engineered,” as one Facebook post puts it, or that something suspicious happened regarding an analysis published by Andersen and other scientists weeks later, concluding that “SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.” PolitiFact wrote about another Facebook post, which is no longer available, that claimed: “Fauci’s fellow scientist could tell early on that the (coronavirus) looked manufactured.” But Andersen said the email shows “a clear example of the scientific process.” In his June 1 tweet , Andersen said, “As I have said many times, we seriously considered a lab leak a possibility. However, significant new data, extensive analyses, and many discussions led to the conclusions in our paper.” Let’s start with the Jan. 31 email. Andersen wrote to Fauci: “On a phylogenetic tree the virus looks totally normal and the close clustering with bats suggest that bats serve as the reservoir. The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (< 0.1 %) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered.” He continued: “We have a good team lined up to look very critically at this, so we should know much more at the end of the weekend. I should mention that after discussions earlier today, Eddie, Bob, Mike, and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory. But we have to look at this much more closely and there are still further analyses to be done, so those opinions could still change.” So, Andersen said that there were “unusual features” of “a really small part of the genome” of the coronavirus that “(potentially) look engineered.” But he said that more analysis was necessary and his opinions “could still change.” That’s exactly what happened, Andersen said on Twitter. On March 17, 2020, Nature Medicine published an article by Andersen and other scientists on the origins of the coronavirus. “Here we review what can be deduced about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from comparative analysis of genomic data,” they wrote. They determined the virus likely originated through “natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer,” or “natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.” They said they “do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible,” because they “observed all notable SARS-CoV-2 features … in related coronaviruses in nature.” But Andersen and his colleagues noted that “it is currently impossible to prove or disprove” the theories of origin they described. “More scientific data could swing the balance of evidence to favor one hypothesis over another. Obtaining related viral sequences from animal sources would be the most definitive way of revealing viral origins.” Fox News host Laura Ingraham highlighted the Jan. 31 email on her June 2 show , adding that there was a phone call between Andersen, Fauci and others (the emails indicate there were a “series of calls” including one on Feb. 1) and that Andersen thanked Fauci before the Nature Medicine article was published. (In a March 6 email, Andersen sent Fauci and others a draft of the paper, writing, “Thank you again for your advice and leadership as we have been working through the SARS-CoV-2 ‘origins’ paper.”) Ingraham then says: “Now, mysteriously, Andersen’s article debunking the lab leak theory and also signed by the other colleagues of course was a 180-degree turn from what he told Fauci in January,” saying that Fauci “influenced it.” But Andersen said there was nothing mysterious about the change of his earlier opinion, nor was it a “massive cover-up” as one Australian journalist alleged on Twitter. “It’s just science. Boring, I know, but it’s quite a helpful thing to have in times of uncertainty,” Andersen said . We don’t know what Fauci may have said to Andersen and his colleagues on that Feb. 1 phone call. Among the emails obtained by BuzzFeed News, there are several about the call, some of which appear to be notes and observations sent afterward, but they are heavily redacted. Andersen posted a detailed answer to two questions raised by his email to Fauci: What about the virus looked engineered to him? And what made him change his mind? The June 4 Twitter post includes details about certain features of the virus that “did not seem to have an obvious immediate evolutionary precursor,” he wrote. But, after his email to Fauci, more data was released, including the full genome for a bat coronavirus that is 96% similar to SARS-CoV-2. Andersen said the researchers conducted “much more extensive investigations,” including looking at the literature from the Wuhan lab and research techniques used there, and performing analyses of SARS-CoV-2. He said much was done in “a matter of days” leading the researchers to “relatively quickly reject our preliminary hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 might have been engineered.” “This is a textbook example of the scientific method where a preliminary hypothesis is rejected in favor of a competing hypothesis as more data become available and analyses are completed,” he said. As we’ve written recently , while scientists have found SARS-CoV-2 is similar to bat coronaviruses, the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. The zoonotic transfer theory, which Fauci says he believes is “most likely,” hasn’t been proven, nor have theories of a lab accident. But there have been many calls for more investigation, including by Fauci himself.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Partisans Distort Proposed MOMS Act and Website for Pregnancy Resources\". [/INST] As Republicans face an uphill battle on their restrictive abortion policies for the 2024 election, GOP Sen. Katie Britt — who opposes abortion — has introduced a bill that she says seeks to support pregnant women. But critics have spun the draft legislation into a claim that the senator from Alabama is proposing a government-run database that could track pregnant people. The bill — called the More Opportunities for Moms to Succeed Act, or MOMS Act — has three sections: Within days of the bill’s introduction, partisan media outlets, including the MeidasTouch Network and HuffPost , panned the proposal, misleadingly claiming that it would create a federal database of pregnant people. Some Senate Democrats, led by Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, also opposed the bill. In a statement issued on May 13, they characterized the bill as a means to “push anti-abortion propaganda” through “a new government-run website to collect data on pregnant women and direct them to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers and other ‘resources’ to pressure women into carrying pregnancies to term, no matter their circumstances.” And posts have proliferated on social media , repeating the claim that Britt had proposed creating a “national database of pregnant women.” But the bill includes no such proposal. The claim appears to be based on the first section of the bill, which would create a new government-run website. But nowhere in the text of the proposed law does it say that people who use the site would be required to enter their personal information. Rather, it says that users would be able to opt in to give their contact information and receive follow-up emails or phone calls with “additional resources that would be helpful for the users to review.” The bill doesn’t specify where or for how long the contact information provided by users would be kept, so we asked Britt’s spokesman Sean Ross for further details. He pointed out that the website would function under existing federal privacy guidelines. “Nothing in this bill alters existing federal data privacy laws or regulations related to government agencies, including the Privacy Act of 1974 , the E-Government Act , and existing HHS regulations ,” Ross said in an email, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services. He also highlighted existing rules for websites maintained by the HHS, which Britt’s proposed website would follow. “Submitting personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, address, telephone number, email address, etc. is voluntary and is not required to access information on our website,” the HHS privacy policy says. “We retain the information only for as long as necessary to respond to your question or request, in most cases no longer than three months. We maintain and destroy information submitted electronically as required by the Federal Records Act and the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) records schedules. It may be subject to disclosure in certain cases (for example, if required by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, court order, or Congressional access request, or if authorized by a Privacy Act SORN).” The bill doesn’t mention anything about creating a database with users’ personal information. It does say that within six months of the site’s launch, the secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to report to Congress on website traffic and feedback. The bill specifies that “the report … shall not include any personal identifying information regarding individuals who have used the website.” So, the bill proposes listing pregnancy-related services, except for those involving abortion, on a website where users could choose to share their contact information in order to get more customized results. It does not describe the creation of a nationwide database detailing the whereabouts of pregnant people."

[/INST] Ivermectin , an antiparasitic medication for humans and animals, has been a source of controversy in recent months as unfounded claims that the drug is an effective treatment for COVID-19 have gained traction online. Despite the increasing circulation of these claims, ivermectin is not an authorized treatment for COVID-19. Studies of the drug’s efficacy and safety are ongoing. But, as of now, its use in treating COVID-19 outside of clinical trials is not recommended by the National Institutes of Health , the Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization . (For more, see SciCheck’s “ Ongoing Clinical Trials Will Decide Whether (or Not) Ivermectin Is Safe, Effective for COVID-19 .”) A recent Facebook post highlighted a tweet by Dr. Simone Gold, who has advocated the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, saying that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “officially recommends administering ivermectin as presumptive therapy (giving medication without a diagnosis) to refugees.” Gold continues: “The FDA approved it for human use in February 1996. The media’s claim that ivermectin is only a de-wormer for animals is a flat-out lie.” But by failing to indicate why ivermectin is a recommended treatment for refugees, Gold may leave the false impression that the drug is being used to treat COVID-19. In fact, some of the comments on the post indicate that readers did get that false impression. For instance, one person commented: “Why does the CDC care more about refugees than the American people?”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Can Slightly Alter Menstrual Cycle Temporarily, But Don’t Harm Fertility\". [/INST] Soon after the COVID-19 vaccines rolled out, some women reported brief changes to their menstrual cycles following a COVID-19 vaccine dose. Because there is often a lot of variability in period cycles, though, it wasn’t clear whether the shots necessarily caused the changes. Formal studies investigating the phenomenon have since found that COVID-19 vaccination does appear to be associated with menstrual cycle alterations — but the changes are small and fleeting. Multiple studies , for example , have now shown that a COVID-19 vaccine dose is associated with a short delay until a person’s next period — on average, less than one additional day — and that the delays are gone within the next cycle or two. Experts who have conducted the studies have emphasized that the changes are not concerning , given the small effects and the fact that an abundance of other data show no effect of COVID-19 vaccination on female fertility. Still, women should be aware of the possibility, so they’re not surprised if their period is a bit different after they get vaccinated. Despite the robust evidence, some people are pointing to the menstrual cycle changes to baselessly suggest that the COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe. The latest online furor over the topic stems from an undercover video released on Feb. 2 by Project Veritas, a conservative activist group known for producing controversial undercover videos using deceptive practices . In the video, a man named Jordon Trishton Walker, who is identified as a Pfizer director, alluded to menstrual cycle changes following vaccination. “There is something irregular about their menstrual cycles,” he said, “So, people will have to investigate that down the line because that is a little concerning.” He went on to speculate about the cause of the cycle alterations, and said the vaccine “shouldn’t be interfering” with menstruation. As we said, experts who have looked into this say it’s not concerning. But people opposed to COVID-19 vaccination quickly shared the video, which Project Veritas promoted as a Pfizer “Director Concerned Over Women’s Reproductive [Health] After COVID-19 Vaccinations.” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who has a history of spreading misinformation , retweeted the video, adding suggestively, “Many women have reported problems with their menstrual cycles after taking the vaccines. And women have reported miscarriages as well. We need answers and we will be asking.” Miscarriage, which occurs in around 10% to 20% of pregnancies, is not more common after COVID-19 vaccination, as we’ve written . All of the available evidence suggests the COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy and benefit both the mother and the fetus. On the same day the Project Veritas video was released, other purveyors of COVID-19 misinformation also incorrectly concluded that if the vaccines alter menstrual cycles, then they must be harmful to female fertility. “Menstrual changes even by one day in the cycle influence ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and uterine shedding,” wrote Dr. Peter McCullough, a cardiologist known for spreading COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, on Twitter. “So any perturbation will almost certainly lead to population decreases in fecundity and fertility.” But Viki Male , a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London who has studied menstrual changes after COVID-19 vaccination, said on Twitter that McCullough’s claim was “unfounded.” Numerous studies have not found any effect of vaccination on female fertility. And one study , Male noted , found no reduction in fertility even for the menstrual cycle in which someone is vaccinated. “This makes sense since cycle delays – though they do happen – are in the order of a day, which is longer than the window of implantation in humans,” she added. “Vaccines are meant to temporarily activate our immune system in order to recognize and help prevent or mitigate a future infection so we hypothesize that this temporary activation creates a temporary disturbance in the processes around menstruation which results in some individuals experiencing changes,” Dr. Alison Edelman , an obstetrician and gynecologist at Oregon Health & Science University who has also studied the menstrual change phenomenon, told us in an email. “If someone experiences a change, research demonstrates that for the majority of people it does not appear to be long-lasting,” she added. “We also know that menstruation can be a sign of fertility health – we now have good evidence demonstrating no impact on the ability to get pregnant and that the vaccine is safe for pregnant individuals, which is a population at greater risk of severe illness and death from COVID19 infection.” The video was one of several Project Veritas released with Walker, who purportedly thought he was on a date when he was secretly recorded. FactCheck.org was unable to verify whether Walker was ever a Pfizer employee, or whether he held the claimed title of “Director of Research and Development, Strategic Operations and mRNA Scientific Planning.” Pfizer has not responded to our inquiries about him. A man with his name, however, graduated in 2018 from UT Southwestern Medical School, according to a graduation ceremony program available online. Tufts Medical Center told us he worked as a general surgery intern for a year, and Boston Consulting Group told us he was employed as a consultant from January 2020 until June 2021. This suggests Walker has broad medical training, but no specific knowledge of obstetrics and gynecology or vaccines. Indeed, Male said on Twitter that given Walker’s uninformed comments in the video, “I doubt that this person (who the interviewer says is a urologist) has anything to do with vaccine development or safety.” Studies have consistently found that COVID-19 vaccination is associated with a temporary, slightly longer time between periods. One of the first studies, published last January and led by Edelman, analyzed period tracking app data from nearly 4,000 participants in the U.S. who had normal-length periods and were not using hormonal birth control. The volunteers were enrolled in the study prior to any COVID-19 vaccination, and about 60% of people were vaccinated. Because periods are naturally variable, the researchers looked at cycle length changes before and after vaccination for each person and compared them with unvaccinated people over the same amount of time. Vaccination was not associated with a change in bleeding time, but was associated with less than a one-day increase in cycle length, which rose to about two days for the small group of people who received two vaccine doses in the same menstrual cycle. The cycle length changes went away after one to two cycles. A follow-up study , which Edelman and Male co-authored and published in September, used the same method for a global population of nearly 20,000 people, and found a less-than-one-day increase in cycle length that returned to normal within one cycle. Another study, published in November, took a similar approach with period data inputted from almost 10,000 iPhone users, and identified a half-day or less increase in menstrual cycles after a COVID-19 dose. This increase disappeared within the cycle after vaccination. “Menstrual cycle change following COVID-19 vaccination appears small and temporary and should not discourage individuals from becoming vaccinated,” the paper concluded. A study of 79 people in the U.K., conducted by Male, also found vaccination associated with a small delay in the next period, which quickly returned to normal. The study, while small, did not identify any cycle length changes among vaccinated people using hormonal birth control. Finally, a study of almost 4,000 nurses in North America, which surveyed people every six months, found vaccinated women had a 48% higher risk of reporting a longer cycle than unvaccinated women — a result that did not extend to the next survey. A few studies have identified other possible temporary menstrual changes following vaccination, including increases in blood flow, but these are not as well studied. In one part of the Project Veritas video, Walker, whose remarks were edited, speculated about the mechanism for the menstrual cycle changes, saying “it has to be affecting something hormonal.” He added that “we need to figure out how it is impacting these hormones because the signaling starts in the brain” and “the vaccine doesn’t cross the blood-brain barrier.” A hormone-based explanation is certainly one of the leading hypotheses for why vaccination can cause some small, temporary changes to menstrual cycles. As Male laid out in a review published in Science in November, there are two plausible, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms: one involving the innate immune system’s interim ability to interfere with hormones, and another involving immune cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells, which help control the shedding and regrowth of the uterine lining. Regardless, “nothing untoward is going on in the brain,” Male told us. “We don’t yet know exactly how COVID vaccination is causing these small changes to menstrual timing and flow, but I think the most likely possibility is that aspects of the immune response can temporarily alter the way the hypothalamus, pituitary and ovaries communicate with each other (the HPO axis),” she said in an email. “To be clear, this doesn’t mean that the vaccine gets into or directly affects any of these organs (there is no evidence of this) but rather [that] they are responding to the general immune activation in your body.” “We already know that this can happen in fever, which affects about 15% of people who are vaccinated,” Male continued. “As part of initiating the protective immune response, immune molecules called ‘cytokines’ are produced, and some of these reset the thermostat of the hypothalamus to increase your body temperature. It’s possible that a similar mechanism is at work to alter the timing of periods and one piece of evidence in support of this is that people whose cycles are driven by taking hormonal contraception seem to be less likely to notice a change than people whose cycles are being driven by their HPO axis.” In her review , Male noted that menstrual changes have been reported before for other vaccines, and there is some evidence to indicate that such changes might occur after infection with the coronavirus. The studies on COVID-19, however, she said, have not been as rigorously done as for vaccination, in part because infection is much harder to study. Edelman and Male agree more research is needed in the long-understudied area of menstrual health, not just for the COVID-19 vaccines, but also for other vaccines and diseases. “[W]e need to do a better job of listening and validating the patient experience and integrate issues which are important to the public, like menstrual health, into future vaccine trials so we can better mitigate fears and concerns,” Edelman said. But it’s misleading for others to appeal to such concerns to undermine vaccination, when a significant body of work shows menstrual cycle changes are minor and temporary.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccination During Pregnancy Is Safe, Has Multiple Benefits\". [/INST] Pregnancy puts people at elevated risk of severe COVID-19. Young babies also are particularly vulnerable to hospitalization from COVID-19. Maternal vaccination reduces these risks. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines come with similar side effects regardless of whether a person is pregnant. Research does not show increased risk of miscarriage , birth defects or other pregnancy complications after vaccination, and it indicates vaccination may reduce the risk of preterm birth and stillbirth . A study published Oct. 23 in JAMA Pediatrics adds to the evidence that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are safe and do not lead to problems for newborn babies and infants when given to their mothers during pregnancy. Going against the now-extensive record on COVID-19 vaccines and pregnancy, a recent Instagram post claimed that there is “No Discernable Benefit of COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy.” The post was quoting a Substack newsletter from Dr. Peter McCullough, a prolific spreader of vaccine misinformation. The newsletter focused on the new JAMA Pediatrics study on vaccine safety, also claiming that it found “No Assurances on Safety.” “Surely there was no benefit of COVID-19 vaccination, so why expose mothers and infants to any risk at all?” the newsletter misleadingly concluded. We reached out to McCullough with questions but did not receive a response. This contradicts the conclusions of the authors of the paper, who wrote, “Maternal mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased adverse newborn and early infant outcomes and may be protective against adverse newborn outcomes.” The study was a safety study and was not meant to assess vaccine effectiveness in pregnant women, co-author Sarah C. J. Jorgensen, a pharmacist and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto, told us. The researchers aimed to measure whether the babies of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy had any elevated risks of health problems. Jorgensen said the study “does provide more reassuring data on the safety of these vaccines for the newborns and infants.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 6 months and older, including people who are pregnant, receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine . Other medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine , endorse this recommendation. McCullough misused two pieces of raw data from the JAMA Pediatrics study to incorrectly imply that COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is unsafe and ineffective. He ignored the primary results of the paper supporting the safety of maternal COVID-19 vaccination for babies, as well as the larger body of data showing maternal COVID-19 vaccination is safe and effective. The study used a database, called MOMBABY, that links health records of mothers and babies born in hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Jorgensen and her co-authors based their findings on data from more than 142,000 babies with due dates between May 2021 and early September 2022. The researchers compared babies born to mothers who received at least one mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose during pregnancy with babies whose mothers had never been vaccinated against COVID-19 at all prior to giving birth. McCullough misleadingly referenced unadjusted, or “crude,” data suggesting a very small increased risk of hospital readmission for all causes in newborns up to 4 weeks old born to vaccinated mothers. But the correct statistic to use to determine whether there is a difference in readmissions is the adjusted figure, Victoria Male , a senior lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, told us via email. Male was not involved in the study. There are many differences between people who do or do not take COVID-19 vaccines. Well-done studies track characteristics of people in the groups they are comparing so they can adjust for differences, such as whether they live in high-income areas or have a tendency to engage in healthy behaviors. “The adjusted results, after accounting for differences in the characteristics of the different groups, show no increased risk for neonatal readmission between the two groups,” pediatrics and internal medicine specialist Dr. Malini DeSilva and statistician Gabriela Vazquez-Benitez told us in an email. Both researchers, who were not involved in the study, are affiliated with HealthPartners Institute and study vaccine safety in pregnant people. DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez added that the study did not show an increased risk for neonatal readmission with additional COVID-19 vaccine doses received during pregnancy. The study also followed babies through 6 months of age and found a similar rate of hospital readmission regardless of maternal vaccination status. Jorgensen and her co-authors wrote that the slight increased risk of newborn readmission in the crude data could be explained by the elevated rates of death and severe health problems in newborns born to unvaccinated mothers. The sickest babies had either died or had not left the hospital by the age of 4 weeks and therefore could not be readmitted, so these babies were excluded from the hospital readmission analysis. McCullough’s post also fails to highlight the study’s other findings, which indicate no association between the vaccines and negative effects on newborns. “The study finds that outcomes at birth are actually better for babies born following vaccination in pregnancy, and this finding is unchanged when the authors do additional analyses to take account of the fact that vaccinated families tend to have better healthcare in general,” Male said. The improvements for newborns included lower risk of severe problems such as hemorrhage or seizures, neonatal intensive care unit stays, and death. It’s unclear how great of a role vaccines played in causing these lower risks. Maternal vaccination may have helped improve newborn outcomes by mitigating the risks associated with getting COVID-19 during pregnancy. But the authors of the paper wrote this was unlikely to fully explain the risk reductions they saw. DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez said that “healthy vaccinee bias,” in which people who get vaccines tend to be healthier and more likely to engage in healthy behaviors, could help explain the reduced risks of poor newborn health outcomes — despite attempts to adjust for these factors. They also pointed out that people who give birth earlier in their pregnancies will have less opportunity to get vaccinated. Being born too early can lead to health problems for babies. Regardless, the reduced risk means it’s unlikely vaccination increased the risk of NICU stays, severe health problems or deaths in newborns, the researchers concluded. “It is at least reassuring that they are not elevated,” Jorgensen said. McCullough had other critiques of the data used in the study. But he “misunderstands how the MOMBABY database works,” Male said. McCullough incorrectly wrote in his Substack post that if a mother delivered at one hospital and later took her baby to another hospital or clinic “for seizures, hemorrhage, etc.,” the pair wouldn’t be linked. The MOMBABY database captures all hospitalizations in Ontario, Jorgensen said, so admission to any hospital in the province would be recorded and linked to the mother. The study was not meant to capture visits to clinics, which likely would be routine or for more minor issues. Finally, McCullough pointed out that the study did not report on miscarriage or stillbirth. “That’s true: this study was not designed to look into that,” Male said. But other studies have shown no effect of COVID-19 vaccination on the rate of miscarriage. And as we’ve said, vaccination may reduce the risk of stillbirth. McCullough also highlighted data showing similar rates of positive COVID-19 PCR test results during pregnancy among vaccinated and unvaccinated women, seemingly to back up his statement that the vaccines have no benefit during pregnancy. However, the work “wasn’t designed as a study to look at vaccine effectiveness for pregnant women,” Jorgensen said. The data on COVID-19 testing were provided in a table describing characteristics of vaccinated versus unvaccinated pregnant women, which were used to adjust for differences between the groups. Jorgensen, Male, DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez all pointed out that in this study, there wasn’t information on whether the vaccinated women who tested positive for COVID-19 got vaccinated before or after getting sick. “We therefore can’t use this data to tell us anything about the effectiveness of COVID vaccination at preventing infection,” Male said. Studies designed to look at COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness have found that it is similar whether the vaccines are given to pregnant or non-pregnant individuals. In the omicron era, vaccination has provided significant protection against severe disease and more limited protection against symptomatic illness — with booster doses improving effectiveness. Furthermore, people who get vaccinated during pregnancy can pass on antibodies to their babies via the umbilical cord and subsequently via breast milk, although the level of protection provided by the breast milk antibodies is unclear. Maternal vaccination during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of infection and hospitalization from COVID-19 during the first six months of a baby’s life, and particularly during the newborn period, according to multiple studies. For instance, Jorgensen and her colleagues did a different study using the MOMBABY registry on the effects of maternal COVID-19 vaccination on babies during the first six months of life. Babies whose mothers had gotten the original primary vaccine series, including at least one dose during pregnancy, had a 45% lower risk of infection and 53% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron than babies of unvaccinated mothers. Protection was better if the mothers got at least one dose during the third trimester. With a booster dose during pregnancy, protection also increased, with babies having a 73% lower risk of infection and an 80% lower risk of hospitalization with omicron. “Regardless of pregnancy status, COVID-19 vaccination remains the best protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death,” DeSilva and Vazquez-Benitez said. “In addition to reducing the risks of severe illness from COVID-19 in pregnant persons, COVID-19 vaccines administered during pregnancy can provide infants with antibodies against COVID before they are eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccines.”"

[/INST] The latest results of several large , randomized controlled trials show no benefit in using the antiparasitic drug ivermectin to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2. The results are consistent with existing evidence that shows the cheap and accessible drug does not work to treat COVID-19. But a recently published study from Brazil that claims ivermectin decreased COVID-19 hospitalization by 100% and COVID-19 mortality by 92% is giving new wings to those touting ivermectin as a miracle drug. The observational study contains methodological flaws, and is authored by ivermectin activists . And its results are completely inconsistent with stronger studies that did not identify any benefit of using the drug for COVID-19. “From multiple, large well-conducted, double-blind randomized clinical trials of now thousands of participants, ivermectin has not been shown to have any meaningful clinical benefit for the early, outpatient treatment of COVID-19,” Dr. David Boulware , a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School and an adviser for two large trials in the U.S., told us in an email. “Specifically, two large, multi-site randomized clinical trials (Covid-Out; ACTIV-6) have been completed in the United States. These two trials both failed to detect any statistically significant benefit of ivermectin,” Boulware added. In addition, the flawed study got intertwined with a false rumor that the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines website had “now” added ivermectin as a recommended treatment. But that’s not accurate. The drug has been listed on the NIH’s page for antiviral treatments for a while ( here’s an archived capture from June 12, 2021) as a medication “that is being evaluated to treat COVID-19.” But the NIH recommends against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. “Yesterday the National institute of health added Ivermectin to the list of covid treatment ,” former martial arts fighter Jake Shields wrote on Twitter . “ Looks like the conspiracy theorist were right and the ‘experts’ wrong once again,” he said, later referencing the problematic study. His tweet got over 42,000 likes and 13,000 retweets in three days. On Sept. 3, the conservative website The Blaze published a story titled “Ivermectin reduces COVID death risk by 92%, peer-reviewed study finds,” which got over 1,000 shares . The same day, Robby Starbuck, a former Republican congressional candidate in Tennessee, referenced both the study and the supposed addition of ivermectin to the NIH’s website in posts across his social media . “Now’s a good time to think about the mass censorship campaign carried out against those who used it or advocated for the freedom to use it, pharmacists who refused to fill doctors prescriptions and the unending hate people got for treating COVID with it. The attacks on it were all about lining Big Pharma and politicians pockets,” he wrote in a Facebook post . A capture of the post on his Instagram got over 26,000 likes in four days."

JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has made comments that have drawn him into a vortex of controversies involving pets. In a 2021 interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson when he was running for a Senate seat in Ohio, Vance called prominent Democrats, including then-Vice President Kamala Harris, “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.” Those comments were revived and went viral in July. More recently, Vance come under fire for spreading the unfounded claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors’ pets, as we wrote. In a post on X on Sept. 9, Vance said, “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” Former President Donald Trump repeated the falsehood during the presidential debate held on Sept. 10. Now, Vance has become the target of misinformation about his own pet. Vance appeared in a Sept. 18 video on Rumble , again with Tucker Carlson, and joked with the host about online rumors that his campaign had rented a German Shepherd in order to enhance Vance’s image. Social media users then shared a snippet of the interview to amplify the rumors. A Threads post on Sept. 21 shows a clip from the video in which Vance is heard saying, “a rent-a-dog that was given to me by the campaign to make me seem like I’m a dog fan.” Carlson replies: “How weird.” The caption on the Threads post reads: “The campaign got JD a dog to make him appear more human. We must rescue that dog.” Another post on Threads claims, “JD Vance admits he has a ‘rent-a-dog’ and the dog is to ‘ …make me seem like I’m a dog fan.’ Where is the ASPCA when you need them to step in and remove the poor dog?” A longer clip from the interview , which shares the complete quote from Vance, was posted by the Tucker Carlson Network on Instagram with the caption, “JD Vance introduces us to his supposed ‘rent-a-dog’ as the Left likes to claim.” On the Instagram post, Vance introduces his dog, Atlas, and laughingly says, “I found out on the internet a few weeks ago that he’s actually a rent-a-dog that was given to me by the campaign to make me seem like I’m a dog fan.” Vance then tells Carlson that his family “got him when he was an eight-week-old puppy.” Vance adds, “It’s like shocking to me that anybody would think that he’s not our puppy.” Vance also mentions that the dog accompanies him on the campaign trail. “He’s on the road with us,” he tells Carlson."

[/INST] President Joe Biden asked the Department of Defense on July 29 t o “look into how and when they will add COVID-19 to the list of vaccinations our armed forces must get,” due to the d elta variant of the novel coronavirus causing a spike in COVID-19 cases. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced Aug. 9 that he “ will seek the President’s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon the U.S. Food and Drug Administration licensure, whichever comes first,” after consulting with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the service secretaries and the rest of the Joint Chiefs. The next day, a fabricated article appeared on the website of Real Raw News with the headline, “ Marines Rebuke Def. Sec.: ‘No Mandatory Vaccinations for My Marines. ’” The bogus article claims to have reviewed the transcript of a phone call in which the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. David Berger — who serves as one of the Joint Chiefs –“rebuked” the mandate and “lambasted Austin and branded him a traitor.” The article has been shared nearly 8,000 times on Facebook. The website features a disclaimer on its “ About Us” page stating, “ Information on this website is for informational and educational and entertainment purposes. This website contains humor, parody, and satire.” Despite the website’s disclaimer, the headline of the article has been widely reshared in posts on social media as if it were accurate, with some adding , “WOW! Give this Gen. a fifth star!” But Berger didn’t “rebuke” the vaccine mandate and, in fact, has encouraged members of the military to get the vaccine. “ There is absolutely no truth to the contents of this article,” a Marine Corps spokesperson told us in an email . “We continue to emphasize the importance of getting the vaccine against COVID-19 as a matter of personal health, force protection, and national security.” On Dec. 22, 2020, in a photo published in the Marine Corps Times , Berger received a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He also encouraged other Marines to do the same in a video and a tweet , stating, “ I received my #COVID19 vaccination today. It was great to see many frontline medical workers getting their shot as well. As the vaccine becomes available, I encourage all Marines and their families to get the shot to slow the spread of the virus.” As of Aug. 9, 73% of active-duty personnel had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to Defense Department officials . The Department of Defense Immunization Program can require all active-duty personnel to receive certain vaccines. Under certain circumstances, the department can also “administer medical products for force health protection purposes that are not FDA-approved, or not approved for the particular use involved, in accordance with DoDI 6200.02.” Service members who have religious objections to receiving a vaccine can seek an exception defined by their individual military service’s regulations, Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby said. There are exemptions for medical reasons as well, including pre-existing medical conditions. Update, Aug. 23: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. At a press conference the same day, Kirby said, “So now that the Pfizer vaccine has been approved, the department is prepared to issue updated guidance requiring all service members to be vaccinated.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Distort Missouri Divorce Law Regarding Pregnancy\". [/INST] Nowhere in Missouri law does it say pregnant women are barred from getting divorced. But a judge handling a case where one party is pregnant may wait to finalize that divorce until the baby is born, which, experts told us, is done in order to consolidate custody and child-support agreements with other end-of-marriage arrangements. This can happen in other states , too. But recent posts on social media have revived an old claim that first circulated in 2022, saying, “Women in Republican-controlled Missouri cannot divorce their spouse if they are pregnant.” That version of the claim was shared by Brian Tyler Cohen, a liberal commentator with a large social media following who we’ve written about before . His Instagram post garnered more than 10,000 likes and was copied and reposted by others, including MSNBC commentator Joy Reid. Cohen is misrepresenting divorce procedures in Missouri, though. Either spouse is free to file for a divorce during pregnancy in Missouri. Someone petitioning for divorce must answer eight questions , including the dates of marriage and separation, proposed custody and support arrangements for any existing children, and “[w]hether the wife is pregnant.” Barbara Glesner Fines , a professor and dean emerita of the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, explained to us in an email, “Nothing in the statute permits a court to make any judgments regarding custody or support for an unborn child, so those arrangements need to be made after the child is born. Likewise, there is nothing in the statutes that expressly prohibits a court from finalizing a divorce while a party is pregnant.” “Procedurally,” she said, “a court could grant the divorce and make arrangements for child custody and support for any children who have been born. Then, if and when another child is born after the divorce, one of the parents could bring a separate action for parentage, custody and support for that child.” The claim first circulated online in 2022, when news outlets published stories about women in Missouri who had experienced delays in their divorce proceedings due to pregnancy. The articles included comments from some lawyers who attested to the custom of Missouri judges to wait until birth to finalize a divorce, although none of them pointed to a statute or court rule that mandated judges to do so. “I suspect that the real reason they aren’t granting divorces comes down to efficiency,” Fines said. “If the court waits until the child is born, issues of divorce, property division, parentage, parenting plans, and support can all be determined in one action. If the court determines these issues while a parent is pregnant, there will have to be a second court case after the child is born. The court will have to reconsider all the same complicated factors for custody and support that it did in the first action and it is possible that the custody and support decisions for any children involved in the first action might need to be altered.” “So, bottom line, what I suspect is happening is that courts are exercising their discretion to schedule hearings and render judgments in a way that is more efficient,” Fines said. Mary Kay O’Malley , director of the Child and Family Services Clinic at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, agreed. “It’s not a statute in the divorce law — what it is is a practicality issue,” she told us in a phone interview. Importantly, Missouri is one of 22 states that has adopted a version of the Uniform Law Commission’s Parentage Act , which offers a legal framework for parent-child relationships that is consistent across states. That act, as adopted into Missouri state law , says, “A man shall be presumed to be the natural father of a child if” the baby is born within 300 days of the end of the marriage “by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity, or dissolution,” which is the legal term for divorce in Missouri. So, the law “contemplates that divorce could be granted during pregnancy,” Courtney Joslin , a professor at University of California, Davis School of Law and contributor to the most recent update of the Uniform Parentage Act in 2017, told us in a phone interview. Joslin explained that California, where she lives and works, also has nothing in state law “that precludes granting a divorce when a spouse is pregnant.” She pointed to the 300-day rule, which is also in California state law . The recent focus on Missouri in social media posts is likely due to a bill introduced by state Rep. Ashley Aune that would change the law to specifically state that a divorce could be finalized if the couple is expecting a baby. The proposed addition to the state’s existing law says: “Pregnancy status shall not prevent the court from entering a judgment of dissolution of marriage or legal separation.” A similar bill was introduced in Texas in 2023, but it died in committee."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Online Posts Misrepresent Purpose of USDA Community Garden Database\". [/INST] Fresh and affordable fruits and vegetables are vital for the health of a community, but there are many communities in the United States that do not have access to fresh foods. These areas are known as food deserts . They are characterized by low-income areas where people have limited public transportation. There are an estimated 19 million Americans whose communities don’t have conveniently located grocery stores or supermarkets, according to a 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Food deserts disproportionately affect Black communities, researchers found in a paper published in Preventive Medicine . That’s why the USDA created the People’s Garden, an initiative to help make fresh food available to communities that have barriers to access. The initiative was launched in 2009 with gardens planted at USDA facilities and in communities around the country. In May 2022, the USDA announced a “reopening” of the program with the planting of a garden at the department’s headquarters in Washington, D.C., with plans to expand the program to include “flagship gardens” in 17 cities. Four months later, the USDA expanded the program to include “eligible gardens nationwide.” “School gardens, community gardens, urban farms, and small-scale agriculture projects in rural, suburban and urban areas can be recognized as a ‘People’s Garden’ if they register on the USDA website and meet criteria including benefitting the community, working collaboratively, incorporating conservation practices and educating the public,” the USDA said in a Sept. 9, 2022, press release. The People’s Garden web page has a map of all registered community gardens in the program. But an Instagram post on Sept. 21 misleadingly suggests a nefarious intention behind the People’s Garden program. The post shows a garden in the background and a headline dated Oct. 4, 2022, that reads: “USDA now asking people to register their vegetable gardens for national database.” There are two faces in the foreground of the post. One says, “Register your garden.” The other replies: “No, I don’t think I will.” The caption at the top of the post reads, “USDA: ‘let’s register and put you on a publicly available map so everyone knows where the people who grow their own food are.” The post received nearly 17,000 likes. Another social media post shares a similar view of the USDA program, saying: “Man claims the USDA is cracking down on people with personal gardens that grow their own vegetables.” But the People’s Garden program is voluntary and doesn’t require individuals to register their home gardens. The program is aimed at encouraging the creation of community farms and gardens that “produce local food, practice sustainability, and bring people together in their community,” as the USDA website explains. The headline on the Instagram post appears to come from a 2022 article that said, “In a move that has many folks scratching their heads, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has renewed its push for the People’s Garden Initiative which now includes registering vegetable gardens nationwide.” The article also said, “But those who have been following the USDA closely for years know that they couldn’t care less about your health and nutrition.” As we said, the posts misrepresent the USDA’s mission for the People’s Garden. Private farms and gardens aren’t eligible for the program and don’t need to register with the USDA. Update, Oct. 3: A USDA spokesperson told us in an Oct. 3 email, “Because this is a celebration of both community and gardening, private home gardens are not eligible” to register in the People’s Garden program. There are 1,500 community gardens registered in the People’s Garden database, the spokesperson also said."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccination Increases Immunity, Contrary to Immune Suppression Claims\". [/INST] The two messenger RNA, or mRNA, COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna work by priming the immune system so it can respond more quickly to a coronavirus infection. Large, randomized controlled trials and a substantial body of real-world data support the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines, which continue to provide strong protection against serious illness and death, especially after one or two booster doses. Conservative television host Tucker Carlson, however, argued that the vaccines might be harming the immune system. On his July 21 broadcast on Fox News, he used dubious sources and cherry-picked and misrepresented data to incorrectly conclude that “it’s looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system.” His comments were also shared on social media. “Is it possible that the vaccine actually can hurt you, especially if you keep getting boosted? Can it weaken your immune system? Well, that looks possible,” he said, citing the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology, which he said “published the findings of several mRNA researchers, and we’re quoting, ‘In this paper, we present evidence that vaccination induces a profound impairment in type one interferon signaling, which has diverse adverse consequences to human health.’” Carlson went on to wonder why the press hadn’t covered the paper, which he quoted from again. “In fact, it’s looking likely that the vaccine might suppress the immune system,” he said. “This fact, the authors concluded, will ‘have a wide range of consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections.’” Carlson then falsely claimed that a study in the prestigious British journal the Lancet made “similar findings.” Virtually none of what Carlson said was accurate, however. It’s not “fact” that the vaccines suppress the immune system, nor is there any reliable evidence to suggest that it could be true. The paper that Carlson cites, which was written by some individuals opposed to COVID-19 vaccination, misrepresents and distorts other scientists’ findings to make illogical and unfounded claims. The lead author of the Lancet paper similarly told us that his work, which Carlson misrepresented, “does not show any” of what Carlson alleged. Carlson’s primary evidence for the vaccines harming the immune system is a much-criticized Food and Chemical Toxicology paper written by several individuals known for being opposed to vaccination or for spreading health misinformation. Lead author Stephanie Seneff is a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism and has pushed a theory linking the herbicide glyphosate to COVID-19, among other unfounded scientific views. Senior author Dr. Peter McCullough is an internist who has repeatedly spread misinformation about COVID-19 treatments and the vaccines. Another author, Greg Nigh , practices naturopathy, a form of alternative medicine that has often embraced pseudoscientific methods. When the paper was first published in April, numerous critics condemned it , with some calling for it to be retracted . (That effort was denied . Notably, the paper appeared in the journal after the editor-in-chief put a call out for papers “on potential toxic effects of COVID-19 vaccines.”) The paper , which does not present any original research, is a review coupled with an analysis of data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, the United States’ early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. VAERS reports can be submitted by anyone, are not vetted for accuracy, nor do they mean that a reported symptom was necessarily caused by the vaccine; the data have often been mined to incorrectly claim vaccines are dangerous. Some parts of the literature review are correct, but the conclusions the authors draw about immune function following vaccination are unfounded, experts told us — and the VAERS analysis is flawed, as Jeffrey S. Morris , a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania, has explained on Twitter and on his blog . “This long review article presents many details about various biological pathways, but their links to mRNA vaccines are almost wholly speculative. In some cases, they link to other vaccines, old mRNA technology, or COVID-19 infection, but are not directly linked to mRNA vaccines,” Morris wrote . “In fact, so much of their evidence is from papers on severe COVID-19 infections, not vaccination, much content in this article might be better suited to a paper pointing out potential downstream dangers of severe COVID infections rather than raising alarm about mRNA vaccination,” he added. One of the paper’s core claims is that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines suppress the innate immune system, specifically the type I interferon response. Interferons are antiviral proteins that help limit the spread of a viral infection, although they also can lead to harmful inflammation. This is the supposed basis the authors use — and Carlson cites — to claim that the vaccines would make it harder to respond to infections and increase the risk of cancer. But experts who study the interferon response say that’s bogus. “I am not aware of any report that demonstrates what [is] claimed in the review,” Ivan Zanoni , an immunologist at Boston Children’s Hospital who has studied the interferon response in patients infected with the coronavirus, told us in an email. It “doesn’t make any sense with what we know about the vaccine and how it works, and neither it makes sense to what we know about how the immune system works,” he added. Elina Zúñiga , a molecular biologist at the University of California San Diego who studies interferon and has reviewed its role with COVID-19, agreed. “The authors make some connections to speculate on a possibility, but there is no data or scientific evidence supporting the statement that interferon signaling is suppressed in vaccinated individuals,” she told us in a phone interview. In fact, Zanoni said, available evidence contradicts the notion that vaccination reduces a person’s ability to mount an interferon response. One paper , he said, reported that people who had received one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine prior to being hospitalized for COVID-19 had a better antiviral interferon response than those who were not vaccinated. Another paper also argues against the idea, Zanoni said. A lab at Rockefeller University discovered early in the pandemic that a subset of people who develop severe COVID-19 produce antibodies that block their own interferons. These antibodies prevent the interferons from helping fight the coronavirus early in infection, and likely explain the severe disease. The same lab has since found that the same applies to vaccinated people — and that individuals with the interferon autoantibodies are likely to be at higher risk of severe illness, even after vaccination. If the vaccines were suppressing the interferon response, as the review proposes, vaccinated people with autoantibodies would not be at higher risk because interferons would already be suppressed, Zanoni said. To make its claim that the vaccines suppress interferon, the Food and Chemical Toxicology review cites an unpublished study that found a much larger interferon response in certain immune cells from people with active coronavirus infections compared with those from people before and after vaccination. But an author of the study told us that’s an incorrect interpretation of the findings. “We observed higher levels of interferon signaling in cells from patients with COVID-19 illness than in adults receiving the mRNA vaccines. The paper citing our work is misinterpreting the lack of inflammation to be the same as ‘active suppression,’” Sergei B. Koralov , the senior author of the study and an immunologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told us in an email. He added that his group “did not see anything in our data that implies active suppression.” “We saw very low levels of inflammation in the immune cells following mRNA vaccine in contrast to the high levels that we saw with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection,” he said. “The main message of our manuscript is that even in the absence of inflammation found in the course of infection, vaccination elicits a robust and long-lasting immune response.” Indeed, less inflammation in the context of a vaccine is part of the point — a vaccine is supposed to provide immunity without the harmful effects of infection. “This is not surprising at all and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Zúñiga said of the lower interferon response following vaccination. She also iterated that the finding in no way suggested that the vaccines would diminish the immune system’s interferon response to other pathogens . In an effort to lend credibility to his argument, Carlson also claimed that a Lancet publication supported the conclusions of the Food and Chemical Toxicology paper. Except that’s not right, either. The Lancet paper recommended third-dose COVID-19 vaccine boosters. Carlson cited a comment a Japanese physician, Dr. Kenji Yamamoto, published in a different journal, which claimed the Lancet paper “showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.” After suggesting that the Lancet paper hid “a major finding,” Carlson pointed to one piece of data in table 3 of the paper for viewers to check themselves. “Among people around the age of 80 who have been double vaccinated — that would include people like Joe Biden — the per capita rate of medical incidences, including hospitalizations or death, is nearly twice as high as the rate of serious incidence for the unvaccinated,” he said. Carlson added that the Lancet paper “also includes a chart showing negative vaccine efficacy for all ages after eight months for all participants in the study.” Carlson, however, is distorting cherry-picked data from the paper. “The paper we have published [does] not show any of the claims” Carlson made, lead author Dr. Peter Nordström told us in an email, because they were not statistically significant. The findings that are statistically significant and the conclusions of the paper are “presented in the summary of the paper,” he added. The paper, which was published in February, used nationwide registers in Sweden to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against infection, hospitalization and death for up to nine months after full vaccination, from December 2020 to October 2021. It found that vaccine effectiveness against infection of any severity waned over time, with some differences by vaccine type (Sweden used the two mRNA vaccines and the AstraZeneca vaccine). There was less waning of vaccine protection against severe COVID-19 — but still some after four months, which the authors said strengthened the rationale for implementing booster doses. Nicholas Jewell , chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told us Carlson’s interpretation of table 3 was “hopelessly wrong and misleading.” It’s true that for the 80 years and above age group after about six or more months, vaccinated people had nearly twice the incidence of coronavirus infection of any severity as the unvaccinated (1.8 vs. 1.0 per 100,000 person days). However, that’s the raw data — and again, it’s for infection of any severity, not just hospitalizations or deaths, as Carlson suggested. When the data are adjusted for age and time elapsed since vaccination, Jewell noted in an email, “the data shows the vaccinated individuals in this group to be very slightly better off than the unvaccinated” (a vaccine effectiveness of 4%, rising to 5% with additional adjustments). The vaccine effectiveness numbers are not statistically significant, so they’re very uncertain. In reality, Jewell said, we “simply don’t know what the effectiveness is for this age group on this time scale since vaccination,” although the evidence “still points to vaccinated individuals being protected from the negative outcome.” Not only is it inaccurate to conclude from this data that the vaccinated are at higher risk than the unvaccinated, but Carlson also cherry-picked the data. As Jewell noted, the unadjusted data he highlighted is the only such data in the table that shows a higher raw infection frequency among the vaccinated. “In the other 36 rows,” he said, which show vaccine effectiveness estimates at different times since vaccination for various demographic groups, the vaccinated are the same or better off, sometimes “much better off and definitively so!” Carlson’s interpretation of figure 2 of the paper, which plots the decline of vaccine effectiveness against infection of any severity over time, is also “completely wrong,” Jewell said. That’s because there is considerable uncertainty in the data, shown by the shaded area, which always includes zero. “These shaded areas tell us that we have no evidence for effectiveness after 8 months,” Jewell said. “What the figure similarly does not show is that there is evidence of negative vaccine efficacy.” As for the Japanese physician who claimed the Lancet data “showed that immune function among vaccinated individuals 8 months after the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals,” Jewell said he found nothing to support that in the Lancet paper, as it also appears to be an erroneous interpretation of figure 2. Yamamoto’s comment shows a misunderstanding of the figure, and it also incorrectly generalizes a specific and expected decline in immunity to the coronavirus over time following vaccination with a general decline in immunity to all things. There is no evidence of that in the Lancet paper, nor anywhere else. Correction, July 30: We originally described the lab at Rockefeller University as being based in Italy.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Misrepresent CDC Announcement on COVID-19 PCR Test\". [/INST] In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed and deployed its own polymerase chain reaction, or PCR , test to identify infections with the novel coronavirus (although its initial rollout was beset with some issues). A year and a half later, the federal agency has notified labs that it will — at the end of 2021 — withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the test to the Food and Drug Administration, thereby discontinuing its use. The agency in a July 21 notice recommended that labs use “one of the many FDA-authorized alternatives” and said it “encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses.” Such multiplex tests , including one from the CDC , can look for both the novel coronavirus and multiple types of influenza at the same time — which conserves testing materials and allows public health labs to do influenza surveillance while testing for SARS-CoV-2, or the virus that causes COVID-19. But the CDC did not say it was no longer supporting the use of PCR tests in general, many of which have been authorized by the FDA — or that its original PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 can’t tell the difference between coronavirus and influenza — as viral posts spreading online falsely claim.  “After 180 million positive cases, the CDC have announced their withdrawal statement from using the PCR test to detect Covid, due to its lack of detection to differentiate between Covid and Influenza,” read a July 25 tweet screenshot posted to Instagram. The post received more than 4,000 likes. A July 26 Facebook post similarly claimed : “ Big News- CDC withdraws PCR test from FDA EUA. It’s inability to differentiate Covid from Influenza was #1 reason.” The CDC’s PCR test in question looks only for SARS-CoV-2, not influenza — which is quite different from a test that mistakenly diagnoses influenza cases as COVID-19, as the posts erroneously suggest. Other posts have falsely claimed it was the FDA that made the purported revelation about the CDC’s PCR test, or PCR tests in general. A since-deleted July 23 tweet from “UK Medical Freedom” falsely claimed that t he “FDA announced today that the CDC PCR test for COVID-19 has failed its full review. Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED.” Two days later, on July 25, a controversial gym owner in New Jersey, Ian Smith, falsely claimed in a viral tweet that the “FDA confirms PCR tests not accurate for testing COVID.” He referred to COVID-19 as a “Manufactured crisis.” As we said, the announcement in question came from the CDC and was about plans for the eventual discontinuation of its own test. It is still in use currently. The FDA did not revoke the CDC test’s emergency use authorization or question the reliability of PCR tests, an FDA spokesman confirmed to us. Scientists consider PCR tests a reliable and highly specific diagnostic tool, as we’ve explained before , but distortions about them have persisted amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In explaining the CDC’s decision to end the use of its own PCR test at the end of 2021, Kristen Nordlund, an agency spokeswoman, in an email to us cited “the availability of commercial options for clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including multiplexed (discussed here ) and high-throughput options” — referring to technologies that use an automated process to a dminister hundreds of tests per day. “Although the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019 nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel met an important unmet need when it was developed and deployed and has not demonstrated any performance issues, the demand for this test has declined with the emergence of other higher-throughput and multiplexed assays,” Nordlund said. She continued: “CDC is encouraging public health laboratories (PHL) to adopt the CDC Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay to enable continued surveillance for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, which will save both time and resources for PHL.” The FDA’s website lists a multitude of PCR tests for COVID-19 that have been issued emergency use authorizations. Jim McKinney, an FDA spokesman, told us in an email that to date, “ the FDA has authorized more than 380 tests and sample collection kits to diagnose COVID-19, many of which are PCR tests. PCR tests are generally considered to be the ‘gold standard’ for COVID-19 diagnosis.” “The FDA has not issued any statement questioning the reliability of PCR test results in general and will continue to consider authorization for validated PCR tests,” he added. Dr. Michael Mina , a Harvard University assistant professor of epidemiology , told us that the CDC’s decision regarding its test made sense, given how the landscape has changed. “CDC is likely going to pull its own EUA for its test because hundreds of other labs now have their own EUAs and CDC no longer even needs to use its own test since many companies now have EUAs for manufactured tests,” he said in an email. “The major Companies like Roche, Hologic, Abbott all have their own test kits and instruments. Then the ThermoFishers of the world have EUAs for their PCR kits that can be run in the exact same way as the CDC assay. So there really is no reason for CDC to retain their EUA.” Mina said the move had to be done carefully, since some public health labs may currently be relying on the CDC’s test. “At the end of the day, the CDC EUA was more or less a recipe for how to test for CoVID, and a couple ingredients,” Mina said. “Now we have all these kits and fully automated processes so it’s no longer needed.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Distorts Early Coronavirus Research To Promote Baseless Bioweapon Conspiracy Theory\". [/INST] Scientists have been studying coronaviruses, a family of viruses that infect animals and humans, for decades — the first was identified in chickens in the 1930s. In 1968, after the first human coronavirus was identified in 1965, virologists grouped them and named them coronaviruses for their crown-like surface, which also resembles the outermost layer of the sun called the corona (corona is the Latin word for crown). Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans — four of them, known as common human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1), generally cause mild to moderate symptoms of a common cold. But coronaviruses got more attention in 2003, after the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 , the first coronavirus known to cause a severe respiratory illness in humans, followed by ME R S-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, in 2019. Both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV originated in animals and jumped to humans. Although there is still no proof of how SARS-CoV-2 started, many scientists think the available evidence also points to a zoonotic spillover. If SARS-CoV-2 did escape from a lab in Wuhan, there is a general consensus that it was an accident. A U.S. Intelligence report released in 2021 showed that all agencies agreed that “the virus was not developed as a biological weapon” and “most” said the virus “probably was not genetically engineered,” as we reported . Yet, in a widely shared video misleadingly presented as testimony to the European Parliament, David Martin, a financial analyst , cited unrelated patents and distorted early research on coronaviruses to falsely suggest that scientists in the U.S. created the viruses that cause SARS and COVID-19 as part of a plot to drive vaccine profits. “Ladies and gentlemen, this was premeditated domestic terrorism,” he said of the COVID-19 pandemic (mark 19:22). “This is an act of biological and chemical warfare perpetrated on the human race. … [T]his was a financial heist and a financial fraud,” he added — a quote that was later shared in a Twitter post that has been retweeted more than 75,000 times. Except Martin’s entire argument is bunk. Dr. Susan R. Weiss , a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in a phone interview that his statements are full of inaccuracies and completely distort past coronavirus research. “There is no basis for any of this,” she said. “It makes no scientific sense.” Martin has pushed several conspiracy theories about the pandemic. In 2020, he was a central figure in the second “Plandemic” video, which also falsely claimed that the pandemic was planned, as we’ve written . Part of the appeal of Martin’s video — and lending false legitimacy to his claims — is that at first glance, it appears he is speaking in front of the European Parliament and giving official testimony. “[C]ant believe my ears, what is being said at the europian union,” a Facebook user said , sharing the video, which shows Martin next to a European Parliament flag in what might look to someone like the European Parliament Hemicycle. “Must watch: This is the opening presentation by Dr David Martin on the origins of Covid in 1965 & Covid Vaccines in 1990!” a Twitter user wrote . “He speaks in front of the European Parliament International Covid Summit III in Brussels on May 3, 2023. Hear and be shocked..!” In reality, only five of the 705 members of the European Parliament participated in the event, which took place in a room of the parliament’s building in Brussels, as part of a three-day meeting organized by COVID-19 skeptics and anti-vaccination activists. The five Parliament members have participated in actions opposing COVID-19 vaccines. Natalie Kontoulis, a press officer for the European Parliament, told us in an email that the meeting “was not an official European Parliament event.” She added, “Members of the Parliament can exercise their mandate freely and bear responsibility for both their activities and their content.” According to the event’s website , the speaker line-up included some prominent COVID-19 misinformation spreaders, including Dr. Robert Malone , Dr. Pierre Kory , and Dr. Ryan Cole . The event content was turned into a book called “ICS 3 – The Whole Truth” and commercialized — a paperback copy sells for $29.99. During the almost 22-minute video, Martin spins a scientifically impossible story that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses are the result of experimentation with common cold coronaviruses that were discovered in the 1960s. “This is actually something that’s been long in the making,” he said of the COVID-19 pandemic (mark 5:31). “In 1967, the year I was born, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus. Isn’t that amazing? 56 years ago — the overnight success of a pathogen that’s been 56 years in engineering.” But Martin, who misleads throughout by implying all coronaviruses might be the same, is misrepresenting a study that involved infecting people with a coronavirus that causes a cold. The virus had not been modified. More important, the notion that a common coronavirus could have been manipulated or engineered to create SARS-CoV-2 is incorrect. “They’re too different,” Weiss said. “We don’t have the ability to turn one into the other.” About a minute later, he said, “Ironically, the common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s. And in 1975, 1976, and 1977 we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it into different animals, pigs and dogs.” “That doesn’t make any sense,” Weiss told us. First, as we said, there are multiple kinds of coronaviruses. Some infect animals and others infect humans — and a few can cross from one species to another one, Weiss told us. “It turns out, the human virus … at least the cold virus, as far as I know, only replicates in humans.” The viruses couldn’t be genetically modified at that time, either, she explained. “We couldn’t engineer viruses at that time,” she said of the 1970s, since the technology to do it, such as cloning, didn’t yet exist. Martin continues to mislead by saying the inoculation of those supposedly modified common coronaviruses created a huge problem in the pig and dog industry, which led Pfizer to patent its “first spike protein vaccine” in 1990. “Isn’t that fascinating? Isn’t it fascinating that we were, we were told that, ‘Well, the spike protein is a new thing,’” he said (mark 7:44). Except, that patent was for a canine coronavirus vaccine, which targets an entirely different virus from SARS-CoV-2. In 2020, we debunked related claims that also confused canine coronavirus with the virus that caused the pandemic. Moreover, scientists have never said that coronavirus spike proteins are “new.” The specific SARS-CoV-2 spike was new, and the genetic sequence was needed to design the vaccines. But one reason why the COVID-19 vaccines could be made so rapidly is because scientists already knew the virus’s spike proteins would be good vaccine targets. The existence of that previous knowledge is not evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bioweapon or as part of a ploy to sell vaccines. Martin also falsely claims that SARS-CoV-1 was created in an American lab. “Are you suggesting that SARS … might have come from a laboratory in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill? No, I’m not suggesting it. I’m telling you that’s the facts — we engineered SARS,” he said. “SARS is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. The naturally occurring phenomenon is called the common cold … SARS is the research developed by humans weaponizing a life system model to actually attack human beings.” There is no evidence SARS-CoV-1 was engineered or came from any lab. The virus naturally appeared in 2002 in China, when it likely jumped from civets to humans, and its origins are linked to bats. Martin pointed to a 2002 patent as supposed proof. But the patent, which is for a method for creating viral vectors, focuses on a pig coronavirus (viral vectors are used to deliver genetic information to cells). As before, the patent is not evidence that the SARS virus was engineered. Martin also distorted the meaning of a line of the patent that says the method could help produce “an infectious, replication defective, coronavirus particle.” “Listen to those words: infectious replication defective,” Martin said suggestively (mark 10:18). “What does that phrase actually mean for those of you not familiar with language? Let me unpack it for you. Infectious replication defective means a weapon. It means something meant to target an individual but not have collateral damage to other individuals.” But he’s wrong again. Replication-defective simply means that a viral particle would be incapable of replicating itself."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"CDC Data Thus Far Show COVID-19 Vaccination Safe During Pregnancy\". [/INST] There is no evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines pose a risk to pregnant people and their fetuses. Although pregnant people were not actively included in the clinical trials conducted prior to authorization, subsequent information about those who became pregnant during the trials and safety surveillance data following the vaccines’ rollouts thus far have indicated the immunizations are safe. Multiple online posts, however, falsely claim that CDC data reported in a New England Journal of Medicine article published in April show that the vaccines are dangerous and trigger miscarriages. “New England Journal of Medicine finds that women who got v4x3d – within 30 days of becoming pregnant and up to 20 weeks pregnant – had a miscarriage rate of 82%,” reads one Instagram post that garnered more than 5,000 likes in a day, using a shorthand for vaccination designed to avoid detection by fact-checkers. A headline on Rumble, a Canadian video sharing site, also touts the false statistic, “FACT: 82% of Pregnant Women in Study Had Miscarriage.” Two Facebook posts and an article on a dubious website similarly highlight the incorrect figure, with one claiming that the information was “deceptively buried” in a footnote in the scientific publication. The 82% miscarriage number, which does not appear in the study, is incorrect because it is based only on people who were vaccinated in their first or second trimesters and reported completing their pregnancies in the follow-up interviews conducted by March 30. The vast majority of women who had received the vaccines that early in pregnancy could not have ended their pregnancies by the time of follow-up unless they miscarried, thereby guaranteeing a very high number from such a calculation. “This is pure number manipulation and propaganda,” Eve C. Feinberg , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told us. The figure also fails a basic sniff test. If 82% of pregnant people were actually miscarrying after being vaccinated, it would be very obvious that there were problems with the vaccines. “[T]his is a ridiculous claim and simply not observed clinically,” Feinberg said. The New England Journal of Medicine article from which the faulty percentage is derived reported on the preliminary findings of the government’s two primary vaccine safety monitoring systems — v-safe , a smartphone-based health checker run by the CDC, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System — for pregnant people who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. It concluded there were no “obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines,” while acknowledging that additional follow-up of pregnant women, especially those vaccinated early in pregnancy, was needed. The incorrect miscarriage calculation stems from a misinterpretation of the v-safe data, which included 3,958 people enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who had been vaccinated with a first dose prior to Feb. 28. CDC researchers contacted these individuals for information about their pregnancies, and from interviews performed as of March 30, 827 people had completed them, either through birth, pregnancy loss or induced abortion. Of these completed pregnancies, 104, or 12.6%, had experienced a “spontaneous abortion,” also known as a miscarriage, before 20 weeks.  Online posts, however, have latched onto a footnote in table 4 that says 700 of the 827 participants “received their first eligible dose in the third trimester.” Because these participants couldn’t have miscarried before 20 weeks, the posts argue, the 700 people should be subtracted from the 827, making the calculation 104 miscarriages out of 127 pregnancies, or 82%. “Don’t tell me you did the math until you took out the 700 people out who got their first dose in the 3rd trimester,” the one Instagram post, now removed , reads . Experts, however, say that doing the math that way is incorrect. “[T]he quoted rate of [82%] is not the miscarriage rate,” Viki Male , a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said on Twitter . “It just tells us that we can’t go from the first trimester to giving birth to a healthy baby in three months.” “[T]his is a bit of a meaningless statistic, since the only way you can complete your pregnancy within 3 months, starting in the first trimester, is to miscarry,” she added. “And presumably the only reason that rate isn’t 100% is because some people vaccinated at the end of the 2nd trimester completed their pregnancies within 3 months by giving birth.” In a statement to FactCheck.org, the CDC also said such percentages are erroneous. “This is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than a 1000 pregnancies were ongoing and outcome data was not available at the time of the report,” the agency said, adding that it “will continue to study the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnancies and closely monitor any safety concerns.” Update, Nov. 8: When we first wrote about this claim, the CDC had presented its 12.6% spontaneous abortion figure, based on 104 miscarriages out of 827 completed pregnancies, in table 4 along with a “published incidence,” or normally expected rate, of 10% to 26%. The agency has since acknowledged that it shouldn’t have tried to calculate a risk estimate since it lacked follow-up data for the vast majority of women vaccinated early in their pregnancies, and corrected its paper on Oct. 14. Given the correction, we removed a paragraph from our original story citing the 12.6% figure. A footnote for table 4 now reads: “No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.” However, this doesn’t lend any credence to the 82% figure, which is still an incorrect calculation — and is still circulating online in newer social media posts highlighting the CDC’s correction. Other data provided in the paper allow for a different calculation that avoids the problem of including participants who were vaccinated after 20 weeks, although it has limitations. “[T]he real way to calculate this is to look at all patients who received the vaccine, not just the patients who completed pregnancy,” Northwestern’s Feinberg said. Data in the paper show that a total of 1,224 people were vaccinated around the time of conception or in the first trimester, so 104 miscarriages out of this total is a miscarriage frequency of 8.5%, she said. And correctly limiting it to just the 96 participants who had a first trimester loss to match the denominator drops the percentage to 7.8%. Feinberg said she didn’t know why the CDC didn’t report this frequency instead. Martha Sharan, a CDC spokesperson, told FactCheck.org that doing the calculation as suggested by Feinberg makes some sense, but would be an underestimate because it’s not known for certain that all the other women didn’t miscarry. “We don’t know what happened to them. We only know what happened to the 827. That’s why they decided to use the 827, because there were definite outcomes,” she said, adding that the research team would be publishing a new report with longer follow-up soon. In an email to the fact-checking site Lead Stories , Sharan explained that the agency struggled with how to best report the data, given that so many participants were still pregnant or had not yet reported an outcome to the registry. “We felt it was important to report all spontaneous abortions that had been observed in the registry thus far. At the same time, we also wanted to limit the analysis to pregnancies for which [we] had final outcome data as there may be completed pregnancies we are not yet aware of because they have not had a scheduled follow-up call,” she said. “In a future report in which more follow-up time has passed, we plan to limit the assessment of spontaneous abortions to completed pregnancies vaccinated at less than 20 weeks and whose estimated date of delivery has passed,” Sharan added. “Because of where we were in the vaccination efforts at the time of data analysis, that method provided both a numerator and denominator of zero. We therefore chose to report spontaneous abortions among all completed pregnancies in this preliminary report.” In her Twitter thread, Male said that both the CDC method and the way Feinberg recommended for calculating the proportion of miscarriages are imperfect. “[G]iven this, I can see why the authors went with reporting the conservative (ie. higher) rate,” she said . “But no matter how we calculate it, it’s still not more than that normal rate.” The New England Journal of Medicine article was upfront about the fact that the data on miscarriage were limited. “Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort,” the paper reads . But with the data that exist, there is no sign that the two mRNA vaccines increase the risk of a miscarriage, which is relatively common , especially in early pregnancy. “[A]s more patients deliver, the true denominator will become apparent,” Feinberg said. “The data will speak for itself, vaccination is safe in pregnant patients.” Update, Aug. 16: The CDC issued a statement on Aug. 11 recommending that pregnant people be vaccinated, based on a new analysis of v-safe pregnancy registry data that included nearly 2,500 pregnant people who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks of gestation. That study , not yet peer-reviewed or published, found no increased risk of miscarriage with vaccination. It calculated the cumulative risk of a spontaneous abortion between six and 19 weeks — otherwise known as a miscarriage — to be 12.8% when adjusted for age, which is within the expected range. “The increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever,” the CDC said in its statement. Update, Nov. 8: The study finding a 12.8% risk has since been published as a peer-reviewed letter to the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 8. Other research also supports those findings. Using data on 105,446 pregnancies from eight health systems that participate with the CDC in the Vaccine Safety Datalink program, another group of researchers found that those who experienced a miscarriage “did not have an increased odds of exposure to a COVID-19 vaccination in the prior 28 days compared with ongoing pregnancies.” Those findings were published in September in a research letter to JAMA . As we’ve written before , in contrast to evidence that COVID-19 can increase pregnancy complications, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to pregnant people. Even though pregnant people were excluded from the vaccine clinical trials, some individuals did become pregnant while participating — and those receiving the immunizations did not miscarry more frequently. Moreover, reproductive toxicity studies of the vaccines in pregnant animals revealed no safety concerns , and as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has pointed out , based on how the vaccines work, there is no reason to think they would be any less safe for pregnant people compared to those who are not. A report published in the journal F&S on June 2 also found no difference, based on vaccination status, in the ability of an embryo to implant or to remain viable in early pregnancy among women who were undergoing in vitro fertilization to become pregnant. The results further support the idea that the vaccines are safe for pregnant people and do not have harmful effects on fertility, an unsubstantiated claim we have previously addressed . Similarly, a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on July 12 found that immunization with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel was associated with protection against infection with the coronavirus among pregnant women, with no difference in the frequency of induced or spontaneous abortions or other negative birth outcomes in those who were vaccinated compared to matched unvaccinated controls.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Vaccines Remain Largely Effective Against Delta Variant, Counter to Claims From Fox News Guest\". [/INST] Update, Aug. 23, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older. The highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus now accounts for 82% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is partly responsible for the rising number of infections across the vast majority of the country. Data show that while the authorized COVID-19 vaccines may be less protective against delta in preventing infections and symptomatic illness compared with earlier versions of SARS-CoV-2, they still largely remain effective — and are very good at preventing serious disease and death. As CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a July 16 press briefing , “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” as outbreaks continue in places with low vaccination rates. But that’s not the message Fox News guest Dr. Peter McCullough has been spreading. In a July 13 interview on “The Ingraham Angle,” the private practice internist played down the risks of the delta variant and falsely said there was “no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.” “We are at a very low baseline now,” he said in reply to host Laura Ingraham, who asked him what to expect next from the pandemic. “We are going to have a slight rise with the delta variant, but the delta variant really is not responsive at all, or protected at all by the vaccines. So 42% of 90,000 proven delta cases in the U.K. have been vaccinated. In Israel, the estimate right now from the Israel health authorities that the vaccine efficacy rate is only about 60 to 70%. So we expect delta cases and in fully vaccinated individuals. It will be a mild rise. It’s easily treatable in high-risk patients. There is no reason right now, no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.” As we’ll explain, McCullough, who has previously been a source of COVID-19 misinformation , including about vaccines, is correct about the Israeli percentage, but wrong about the U.K. one — and there is an abundance of data contradicting his claim that the vaccines do nothing against the delta variant. As for the idea that COVID-19 is “easily treatable,” there is little to support that notion as well, especially with hundreds of Americans still dying every day from the disease. “You’re much, much better off being vaccinated than not,” Frederic Bushman , co-director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens , told us. “The delta variant may reduce the effectiveness [of the vaccines] a little, but still they’re so effective that you get a lot of benefit.” Scientists don’t have information from the clinical trials about how well the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines perform against the delta variant because the phase 3 trials were done at a time before the variant was circulating widely. The variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in October 2020 and is more than twice as transmissible as the original versions of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. Some data also suggest delta may cause more severe disease, but this has not been conclusively established. There are, however, multiple studies of how the vaccines are faring in the real-world against delta, and most show the vaccines are working largely as expected. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21 by Public Health England, for example, found that after the two recommended doses, the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing symptomatic disease in the U.K. fell only slightly, to 88.0% against delta from 93.7% against the alpha variant — another more contagious version of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, that previously predominated in the country. The authors, however, noted that a larger decline and lower effectiveness was observed after a single dose, underscoring the importance of receiving both immunizations. In an unpublished study that has not yet been peer reviewed, the U.K. health agency also found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was very effective at preventing hospitalization with the delta variant, reducing the risk by 94% after one dose and by 96% after two. Other countries have reported similar preliminary results. In an unpublished study from Ontario, Canada, researchers estimated the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic infection with delta to be 87% after two doses, while a report from Scotland, published in the British medical journal the Lancet , pegged the figure at 79% for infection with delta. The Canadian report also found that one dose of the Moderna vaccine was 70% effective in preventing symptomatic disease and 95% effective in preventing hospitalization or death; there were too few COVID-19 cases among the vaccinated to estimate the effectiveness after two doses. Meanwhile, in Israel, the health ministry released preliminary, unpublished information on July 5 suggesting that with the rise of the delta variant in the nation, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was now 64% effective against infection or symptomatic illness, but still 93% effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization. The ministry had previously estimated the vaccine to be 97% effective against symptomatic disease, with similar levels of protection against hospitalization and death, at a time when the alpha variant made up the vast majority of COVID-19 cases. McCullough, therefore, is right that Israel estimated the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine effectiveness at “only about 60 to 70%.” But that is still a substantial amount of protection — and McCullough neglects to mention the vaccine’s excellent ability to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19. In late July, the ministry further reduced its vaccine effectiveness estimate for symptomatic COVID-19 to 40.5%, but once again, found protection against severe disease to remain robust — 88.0% effective against hospitalization and 91.4% effective against severe COVID-19. It’s worth mentioning that some experts doubt the accuracy of the Israeli estimates, which are outliers compared with the other results and rely on a different methodology. In its July 27 scientific brief on the vaccines, the CDC said “more technical information is needed to allow full interpretation.” The most recent Israeli figure, in particular, is based on a small number of cases over a short period of time and should be considered preliminary, according to an expert advising the Israeli government on the coronavirus. The ministry itself also acknowledged the results might be skewed because of differential testing among the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Post Makes Unfounded Claims About Omicron ‘Symptoms’ and COVID-19 Vaccines\". [/INST] Less than a week after the World Health Organization classified a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and designated it by the Greek letter omicron, officials reported the first confirmed case in the U.S. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a White House briefing on Dec. 1 that the patient, who had been vaccinated but had not yet qualified for a booster, had experienced minor symptoms and was improving while self-quarantining in California. By Dec. 5, omicron cases had been found in 15 states in the U.S. C onfirmed cases also had cropped up in Europe, Israel, Australia and Canada. As we have reported, scientists have cautioned that while there are reasons to be concerned about omicron, it’s not yet known whether the variant is more likely than others to spread easily or cause severe disease. On Dec. 5, appearing on CNN , Fauci said: “Thus far, it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe or it really doesn’t cause any severe illness, comparable to delta.” But a tweet posted on Nov. 28 misleadingly suggested that omicron’s “symptoms” are actually caused by the COVID-19 vaccines. The post lists “Some of the symptoms for the Omicron Variant” as “Heart failure, Arrhythmia, Heart inflammation (Myocarditis/Pericarditis), Blood clots, Strokes, Peripheral Nerve Damage, Multi Organ Failure.” The post then misleadingly states: “Omicron sounds like the complications from a certain experimental drug, doesn’t it?” There have been very rare cases of heart inflammation and blood clots associated with certain COVID-19 vaccines, as we will explain later. But there is no evidence that the vaccines cause any of the other listed conditions. All seven “symptoms” are complications of COVID-19 – which is why public health officials have said that the benefit of vaccines far outweigh the risks. The post, which was shared widely on Facebook , appears to have borrowed its content from the website of the Canadian organization Alberta Nationals, which describes itself on its Twitter account as a “ grassroots movement promoting the diaspora of the unvaccinated to Alberta, separation from Canada & nationalization of oil & gas.” A Nov. 28 article on the website claimed “the symptoms listed of the new Omicron Variant of Coronavirus” includes “a number of heart-related complications … including heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.” The article also made the baseless claim that “bureaucrats are already using the Omicron Variant to disguise the rapid increase in sudden and unexplained cardiac deaths in the vaccinated; just as they did with the Delta Variant.” The ill-effects listed in the Facebook post and the online article are not “symptoms” but complications that have been known to develop in those sickened by COVID-19, Ian Musgrave , a molecular pharmacologist/toxicologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia, told us in an email. COVID-19 complications have included arrhythmia, strokes, peripheral nerve damage and multi-organ failure, Musgrave said, adding “some [are] more common than others.” “It is early days in the spread of the omicron variant … so we are not sure if it (omicron) will have the same complication range as the other variants,” Musgrave said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says based on current information, the omicron symptoms mirror those of the alpha and delta variants . They include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Side effects that might appear in the first days after a COVID-19 vaccination include pain, redness and swelling in the arm where one got the shot, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever and nausea. Two of the conditions listed in the Facebook post have been associated with COVID-19 vaccines, however. As we’ve reported, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been linked to an increased risk of rare blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets, primarily in women ages 18 to 49. As of Nov. 24 , the condition, which is known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, has been confirmed in 54 cases, including six deaths, after more than 16.4 million doses of the J&J vaccine. There is also emerging evidence that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines may very rarely cause inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or of the surrounding lining (pericarditis), particularly in male adolescents and young adults . As of Nov. 24 , the agency says there have been 1,949 preliminary reports of either condition in people 30 years of age or younger following immunization with any COVID-19 vaccine. The bulk of the reports, which were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and do not necessarily mean the vaccine caused the problem, involved the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and were more common among males and after the second dose. “Through follow-up, including medical record reviews, CDC and FDA have confirmed 1,071 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis,” the CDC says. Health officials have emphasized that the potential vaccine-related myocarditis and pericarditis cases are rare and the benefits of vaccination still outweigh the risks. An Israeli study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found COVID-19 to be associated with 11 additional cases of myocarditis per 100,000 people, while the Pfizer vaccine was associated with an extra 2.7 cases per 100,000 people.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"It’s Not News, Nor ‘Scandalous,’ That Pfizer Trial Didn’t Test Transmission\". [/INST] More than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a “milestone” in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and “a true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.” The emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval ). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did. “At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,” the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization. Similarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that “excellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,” but that it “is presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,” as well as the duration of the protection provided. On Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. “I think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,” he said. Yet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive “admits” the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed “shocking admission” was “criminal” and “indisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.” The posts cite remarks by Pfizer’s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament’s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10. During the session , a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos , asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: “No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market” (see the 15:31:45 mark). Following the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small. “BREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. ‘Get vaccinated for others’ was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!” said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days. “I find this to be shocking, even criminal,” Roos said in his video statement. But as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines — Pfizer’s nor Moderna’s — were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered. “Our landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,” Pfizer’s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company’s vaccine. That’s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean , assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran , head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, “is typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.” The primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and “given the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,” she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. “But assessing protection against infection requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,” she said. We explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video . Roos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with “no evidence” that the vaccines stopped transmission. I n an appearance on Fox News’ “ Tucker Carlson Tonight ” on Oct. 11, he said that “governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them … do it for your grandmother” and introduced “so-called COVID passports,” mandates and lockdowns “in the name of public health.” “All of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,” Roos said. To be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected. As we’ve reported , that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat. “Being up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,” CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19. In their commentary , Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants. One of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta. “COVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,” Dean and Halloran concluded. Clarification, Oct. 19: At the request of Natalie E. Dean, we changed one word in her statement on what’s needed to measure vaccine protection against infection and contagiousness."

The single relevant straight-news reference to Dewhurst in this fashion says he was initially viewed as a conservative, though as more moderate than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. That story also says Dewhurst had since advocated more GOP-backed causes and been seen as more partisan.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Lift Bogus ‘Quarantine’ Story from Satire Site\". [/INST] A spoof story has been circulating on social media, presented as though it’s real, spreading the false claim that unvaccinated Americans will be sent to “quarantine camps.” It’s completely made up. The story originated on a website called The Stonk Market , which includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says, “TheStonkMarket.com is a financial satire site.” The original story was posted on June 17 with this headline: “President Joe Biden Announces Americans Not Vaccinated Before 2022 Will Be Put In Camps.” Less than a week later, two other sites had copied it. They both included a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the story. But social media users missed the note and left comments like this one on Facebook: “Oh he really wants a civil war…doesn’t he???!!!” Actor Noel Gugliemi, known for his role in “The Fast and the Furious” movies, shared a screenshot of the headline from one of the copycat sites with his 276,000 Instagram followers. He didn’t include a satire disclaimer at all and, instead, posted a comment that claimed, “Either put the poison in you or will try forcing the poison in you, either way you’ll get it or else.” The same screenshot was then featured in a TikTok video that’s been viewed more than 939,000 times. That video then migrated to another Instagram account, where it’s been viewed more than 38,000 times. Not only is the claim about “quarantine camps” completely fabricated, but Biden has said that he doesn’t think vaccines should be federally mandated. As we’ve explained before , as far back as Dec. 4 — before he had taken office and before the first vaccines were available — Biden was asked about potential vaccine mandates. He answered , “No, I don’t think it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don’t think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide, I’ll do everything in my power as president of [the] United States to encourage people to do the right thing.” His administration has maintained that posture since he took office. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki answered a question about the cruise industry and vaccine passports at a May 24 press conference by saying, “[W]e are not instituting vaccine passports from a federal level. We certainly understand that industries will make their own decisions about how to continue their — the work they need to do.” Then, at a July 12 press briefing , Psaki reaffirmed that the federal government wouldn’t mandate vaccinations, although she said the administration would support entities that do require the shots. “That’s not a decision that we are making. That’s not a — that is not our intention from the federal government,” Psaki said, responding to a question about local mandates. “There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.” The administration has encouraged people to get vaccinated, though, consistently highlighting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. And Biden recently emphasized the importance of vaccination since the more easily transmissible delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 has become the dominant variant in the U.S. “[M]illions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected,” Biden said on July 6. “And because of that, their communities are at risk. Their friends are at risk. The people they care about are at risk. This is an even bigger concern because of the delta variant.” He announced a shift in the focus of the vaccination program from large-scale facilities to, instead, “meet people where they are.” The administration is going to focus on supplying vaccines to local pharmacists and physicians and to invest in mobile vaccination clinics that can go to sporting events, places of worship, summer festivals — “wherever we can find people gathered,” Biden said. “Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,” Biden said. The phrase about going “door to door” whipped up controversy among some conservative politicians and media personalities, who cast it as something akin to a mandate or forced vaccination scheme. For example, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, of Colorado, referred to the people knocking on doors as “ Needle Nazis, ” and Fox News host Tucker Carlson said , “I honestly think it’s the greatest scandal in my lifetime by far. … The idea that you would force people to take medicine they don’t want or need, is there a precedent for that in our lifetimes?” But, as we’ve explained , there’s no evidence to support the claim that the outreach effort would result in forced vaccinations. And, contrary to Carlson’s claim that vaccines aren’t needed, t he seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from COVID-19 has declined by more than 90% since the vaccines became available in the U.S. The seven-day average of daily deaths was 2,781 on Dec. 14; as of July 20, it was down to 237, according to the CDC . Psaki has made it clear that the federal government will not require anyone to be vaccinated against their wishes. “What we’re doing is local officials are going to areas where there are lower vaccination rates and providing information on where people can get access to a vaccine, where they can go, that it’s free,” Psaki told reporters on Air Force One on July 7. “It’s up to individuals to decide whether they want to get vaccinated or not.” The outreach effort relies on “trusted messengers” — who are largely doctors and community and faith leaders — going door to door in areas with low vaccination rates to answer questions and talk about the vaccines, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, explained at a July 8 press briefing. So, there is no evidence of a forced vaccination program or quarantine camps for the unvaccinated.

[/INST]  U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said $47 billion raised by the Buffett Rule could finance 611,000 jobs for people rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But that's not really 611,000 jobs. It's job-years. It's the equivalent of 61,100 people employed full-time for just one year. To get to 611,000, you'd have to fire those 61,000 at the end of the year and then rehire another 61,000, and do that for a total of 10 years. When we think of a job, it's not working for just one year. Also missing is the fact that these types of estimates -- even from reputable groups cited by both parties -- can vary widely. To his credit, Whitehouse was citing an estimate that translates into fewer jobs than what other sources say. But the certainty of his statement is undercut by the mushiness of the underlying economic projections. Ultimately, if everyone hired with this money stayed on the job for 10 years, Whitehouse would be off by a whopping 549,900 jobs. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

But Arizona — Maricopa County in particular — has been the target of false and misleading claims and accusations of election fraud spread by Lake and others since Election Day. In a civil suit filed against Hobbs and Maricopa County officials on Dec. 9, Lake made several claims about alleged fraud, including a claim that county election officials violated state law for nearly 300,000 mail-in ballots because there were no chain of custody documents for those ballots. On page 45 of the filing, the suit says, “Maricopa County failed to maintain and document the required secure chain of custody for hundreds of thousands of ballots, in violation of Arizona law.” Lake alleges that there are “whistleblowers and witnesses with first-hand knowledge” that the county violated the state chain of custody rules, which allowed an unknown number of ballots to be added to the count by county employees. The county filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Dec. 15 , claiming Lake misunderstood the forms required in its chain of custody process. The county also said Lake’s claim “regarding chain of custody is based on an incomplete understanding of election administration and baseless speculation about what could happen at the County’s contractor, Runbeck Election Services – not on any allegations of what actually happened.” On Dec. 19, Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson ruled Lake’s lawsuit could go to trial on two out of 10 initial counts — including the claim about the ballot chain of custody and a claim that some ballot printers malfunctioned because of an “intentional action” by an election official on Election Day, causing Lake to lose. A witness for Lake, Heather Honey, an investigator and supply chain auditor, testified at trial that county election officials had not provided her with the delivery receipt forms that would show the county followed chain of custody procedures for ballots placed in drop boxes on Election Day. But during cross-examination by the county’s attorney, Honey testified that the forms did exist and that she had seen them in photos — they just weren’t physically provided through a public records request. Honey also testified that she was told that employees of Runbeck Election Services, an election software company headquartered in Phoenix, submitted about 50 ballots for family and friends into the ballot stream improperly. Honey later said she couldn’t identify those 50 ballots. On Dec. 24, Thompson dismissed the last two counts of Lake’s suit, saying that Lake failed to provide evidence that officials intentionally took steps that changed the election outcome. The judge said , “Every single witness before the Court disclaimed any personal knowledge of such misconduct. The Court cannot accept speculation or conjecture in place of clear and convincing evidence.” Days later, the judge ordered Lake to pay Hobbs $33,040 for witness fees. Lake appealed Thompson’s ruling on Dec. 27, asking the state Court of Appeals to take “special action” and expedite her request to throw out the results of the election. The court agreed to hear the case on Feb. 1, KGUN reported . Lake also filed a petition to transfer the appeal to the Arizona Supreme Court on Dec. 30. The Supreme Court denied Lake’s request , saying Lake needs to go through the appeals court process. Meanwhile, claims that there was no chain of custody for ballots in Maricopa County are still spreading on social media. In a Dec. 29 interview with conservative commentator Larry Elder, Lake claimed she “won in a landslide,” saying “almost 300,000 ballots had no chain of custody” and “came out of who knows where.” Lake’s interview was shared in a Facebook post by Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers that received more than 106,000 views. A Facebook video posted on Dec. 29 shared the claim that chain of custody documents for 300,000 ballots don’t exist; the post has received nearly 1,500 views and 1,700 likes. The video includes the image of a tweet from a lawyer that said, “Records required to certify chain of custody vanished, as unaccounted ballots cast election in doubt.” But there’s no basis for the claim that the chain of custody documents “vanished.” As we said before, Lake’s witness testified that the forms do exist and that she has seen photos of them. Matthew Roberts, spokesperson for the Maricopa County Elections Department, told us in an email on Jan. 6 that the county followed all the required chain of custody policies and procedures during the 2022 election. “There are robust tracking and security procedures in place to document and ensure proper chain-of-custody of early ballots on Election Day. These policies and procedures were followed on Election Day, as well as throughout the early voting period,” Roberts said. “At no point during the process were chain of custody policies broken or procedures not followed and documented.” The Maricopa County Elections Department published a 2022 Elections Plan for the primary and general elections, which said that each mail-in ballot is tracked with a unique mail barcode and a “robust set of chain of custody documents that track an early ballot as it progresses through every step of the process.” “The combination of the unique barcode and these chain-of-custody documents ensure the integrity and security of the early ballot,” the plan said. Before the ruling that Lake’s lawsuit could go to trial, Roberts explained the chain of custody process for mail-in ballots in a Dec. 13 email to FactCheck.org. “The Elections Department picks up the ballots that are returned by mail directly from the USPS regional warehouse in Phoenix. They are retrieved by a bipartisan team of two,” Roberts said, referring to the U.S. Postal Service. Roberts said mail-in ballots that are picked up from the USPS warehouse are then delivered to Runbeck Election Services. The elections department staff that picked up the ballots and the Runbeck staff then sign a chain of custody transfer slip to document the transfer. Afterward, Runbeck scans the affidavit envelopes to get an image of the voter signatures and puts those into an automated system for the Maricopa County Elections Department to conduct signature verifications . According to the 2022 Elections Plan , “After the initial inbound scan pass, Runbeck then stores the unopened ballot packets in their facility in a secure, water and fireproof vault, while Elections Department staff review the digital images of voter affidavit signatures… thus eliminating the need to handle the actual physical ballot packet multiple times.” The pickup and drop-off of ballot packets between USPS, Runbeck and the Maricopa County Tabulation and Elections Center happen “on a regular and regimented schedule to ensure that processing timeframes needed to tabulate ballots in a timely manner can be maintained,” according to the elections plan . Ballots that are placed in a secure and sealed drop box are picked up by ballot couriers, who work with the elections department in bipartisan teams of two to retrieve the ballots. The team then fills out a chain of custody form with the Vote Center inspector or a representative from the government facility, and the ballot box is sealed with tamper-evident seals, Roberts told us. “All of the seals are logged on the form. The ballots are returned to the Elections Department where we complete an audit of the ballots,” Roberts said. Once the audit is done, the ballots are delivered to Runbeck and follow the same steps as the mail-in ballots."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Distort Testimony of Federal Health Officials on Employee Vaccinations\". [/INST] There are three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. that have all received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. More than 279 million vaccine doses had been administered in the U.S. and 60.5% of adults had received at least one shot as of May 21. ( See SciCheck’s articles on each of the vaccines: “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine ,” “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine ” and “ A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine.” ) On May 11, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, testified at a Senate committee hearing on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Questioned by Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina about the number of their employees who have received COVID-19 vaccines, Fauci estimated that “around 60%” of NIAID staff have been vaccinated and Marks said a similar percentage of FDA employees have been vaccinated. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also testified before the Senate committee but did not state how many CDC employees have been vaccinated. But since then, viral social media posts and digital stories have distorted what Fauci, Marks and Walensky said. The headline on an article that claims more than 18,000 views on WeLoveTrump.com reads, “Half of CDC, NIH, and FDA Employees Refused the Experimental COVID-19 Jabs.” (Along with twisting Fauci’s words, the headline misrepresents his government position. He is director of NIAID, which is one of 27 institutes and centers that make up the National Institutes of Health .) A similar Instagram post shows a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet posted by the account @Breaking911 reading, “NEW: About 40-50% of CDC, FDA employees are refusing the COVID-19 vaccine according to Fauci, Marks.” The percentages in these claims distort the health officials’ responses to say that “40-50%” of their employees have “refused” the vaccine. While reviewing ongoing COVID-19 prevention measures and guidance during the Senate committee hearing, Burr posed the question to Fauci, Marks and Walensky. None of the federal health officials said members of their staff refused to get COVID-19 vaccines. A n FDA spokeswoman told us in an email: “The post’s suggestion that a majority of staff have refused to get their vaccine is absolutely false. The FDA is offering COVID-19 vaccines to employees and we know employees are also choosing to receive vaccines through local, state or privately operated vaccination sites. Because the FDA does not mandate vaccinations or require staff to report their vaccinations, we do not know the exact percentage of our staff who have not yet been vaccinated, but we have been encouraged to hear from the large number of our staff who have chosen to be vaccinated.” We reached out to the CDC and NIAID to clarify if any employees were refusing vaccines, but did not hear back. We will update this article if we get a response. Update, May 28: After we published our article, the NIAID sent us a statement that said Fauci “did not say that 40 to 50% are refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.” The statement continued: “To our knowledge, the percentage of NIH staff who have received a vaccine at NIH or self-reported receiving a vaccine in the community is close to 67%. The actual number may be higher since self-reporting is voluntary and there may be staff who received the vaccine in the community but have not reported it to us.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation has no control over our editorial decisions, and the views expressed in our articles do not necessarily reflect the views of the foundation. The goal of the project is to increase exposure to accurate information about COVID-19 and vaccines while decreasing the impact of misinformation.

[/INST] Country singer Jason Aldean struck a discordant note with the July 14 release of a video of his song “Try That in a Small Town,” which includes a scene shot in front of a Columbia, Tennessee, courthouse where a Black teenager was lynched in 1927 and where a race riot occurred in 1946. Aldean’s song and video — which shows images of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and demonstrations in other countries — warns that “city” crimes and disrespect for police or the flag won’t be tolerated in a small town. “Well, try that in a small town. See how far ya make it down the road,” Aldean says in the song. Critics have said Aldean’s video and lyrics are offensive. Tennessee State Rep. Justin Jones, a Democrat, tweeted that it was a “heinous song calling for racist violence.” The Country Music Television channel, CMT, stopped airing the video on July 17. Aldean responded to the criticism of his video in a tweet on July 18 , saying, in part: “In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless, but dangerous. There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far.” In response to CMT’s action, some of Aldean’s peers have expressed support for the singer, and former President Donald Trump called him “a fantastic guy who just came out with a great new song” in a post on Truth Social. But posts on social media have also fabricated claims about support for Aldean. A July 23 post on Facebook claimed, “Luke Bryan Pulls His Videos From CMT: ‘Time For The Bud Light Treatment,'” referring to the conservative backlash against Bud Light following the beer company’s brief partnership with a transgender performer. Another Facebook post carried the same headline and claimed, “Standing in solidarity with his good friend Jason Aldean, Bryan notified CMT that he was pulling their license to use his material effective immediately.” But there’s no evidence that Bryan, an award-winning country music star and judge on ABC’s “American Idol,” has done any such thing. The claim about Bryan originated on a satirical website , Uplifting Today, which explains in a footnote to the story that the site “produces news satire and parody for global publication.” The social media posts, however, aren’t labeled as satire. Billboard magazine reported that the posts about Bryan — as well as some claims about other country singers’ support for Aldean — are false. A CMT representative told Billboard that Bryan has not pulled his videos from the channel. Update, July 26: Snippets of a news clip of BLM protests from 2020 shown in Aldean’s video have been removed, the Washington Post reported on July 26. The production company that made the video did not respond to questions about when and why the video was edited, the Post said."

It is worth noting that Congress designed PPP loans — which were established in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — to be forgiven in order to help small businesses meet payroll during the pandemic, while student loans are provided with expectation of repayment. One person who criticized the student debt forgiveness plan appears to have been wrongly targeted by opponents, though. Ben Shapiro, a conservative commentator, tweeted on Aug. 23: “I have a controversial idea about paying off student loan debt: don’t take out debt you will likely be unable to pay off, and don’t ask others to pay off your debts.” Shortly afterward, partisan social media accounts began replying to his post, suggesting that he’d been the recipient of roughly $20,000 in PPP money that was forgiven. The suggestions were made with screenshots that appear to have come from ProPublica’s searchable database of PPP recipients, which shows that someone named Ben Shapiro received a loan for $20,832 in 2021. But that person is listed as being a realtor in Los Angeles, and there is only one person by that name who is licensed to sell real estate in Los Angeles. He’s not the same Ben Shapiro who works as a political commentator. While the political commentator did grow up in Los Angeles and lived there for most of his life, he left in 2020 and moved to Florida . Another database of PPP recipients run by a watchdog organization called Accountable.Us shows a PPP loan of the same amount going to yet a different Ben Shapiro — a real estate agent in New Jersey — in 2020. Neither of the real estate agents who have the same name as the political commentator returned our calls for comment. Also, neither of the databases showed PPP loans going to Ben Shapiro, the political commentator, or to the business of which he’s a partial owner, the Daily Wire, or to the Daily Wire’s parent company, Bentkey Ventures . The Daily Wire didn’t respond to our email asking to clarify whether or not any of Shapiro’s associated businesses had PPP loans. But Shapiro did address the claim that attributed the ProPublica screenshot to him on Twitter , saying: “This is a lie.” Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Pfizer CEO Got Vaccinated, Contrary to Claim in Video\". [/INST] The chief executive officer for Pfizer, Albert Bourla , has gotten his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, he told Axios in early March. But a video posted to Facebook on March 24 is blaring the false claim: “Pfeizer CEO refuses [vaccine],” with an emoji that looks like the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a syringe. The video was shared by a page called “Tru York,” which has recently shared several other videos discouraging viewers from getting vaccinated. The page’s administrators are based in Canada and describe it as an “Entertainment Website · Political Party · Media/News Company.” The video features a clip from an interview Bourla did with CNBC in December, in which he said that he would take the vaccine as soon as he could, but he didn’t want to set an example for “cutting the line” to get it earlier. Bourla described himself as “59 years old, in good health … not working on the frontline,” so he wasn’t prioritized for the shot. Even though that statement is included in Tru York’s video, comments from viewers suggest that the written claim at the top of the video made a bigger impression. One such comment said : “TRANSLATION … I’m too rich and self important to kill myself taking a poison vaccine that I made.” But, as we said, Bourla said in that interview that he intended to take the vaccine — and he has now gotten his first shot. So the claim that he “refuses” to take it is false. The video also seems to suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was hesitant to get a COVID-19 test. The video shows Fauci saying in an interview, “I have no symptoms, there’s no reason for me to take a test.” But that interview was from March 15, 2020, about nine months before the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to the first COVID-19 vaccine . At the time, testing for the disease wasn’t widely available . CNN’s Brianna Keilar had asked Fauci if he would be tested following a public appearance where he had touched the same microphone and podium that had been touched by several other people. “No, I’m not taking a test for the simple reason: I have no symptoms … I have been practicing pretty good social distancing,” Fauci said. In an event that was covered by the media , Fauci received a COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 22. (See SciCheck’s articles on each vaccine: “ A Guide to Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 Vaccine, ” “ A Guide to Moderna’s COVID-19 Vaccine “ and “ A Guide to Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 Vaccine .”) As he was receiving his first shot, Fauci explained that he was taking the vaccine because he sees patients at the National Institutes of Health clinical center and “as important, or more important, as a symbol to the rest of the country that I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated so that we could have a veil of protection over this country that would end this pandemic.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Chiropractor Again Peddles False, Misleading COVID-19 Claims\". [/INST] A St. Louis chiropractor who in April was accused by federal officials of deceptively marketing unproven COVID-19 treatments is airing baseless and false claims about the novel coronavirus that causes the disease and public health measures designed to prevent its spread.  Eric Nepute — who was the first person charged with violating the COVID-19 Consumer Protection Act, and who has spread misinformation that we’ve debunked before — took to an Aug. 17 livestream on Facebook to baselessly suggest that recent pandemic-related events, as well as the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, are somehow actually efforts “to keep you distracted” from the issue of voter fraud. In the video, viewed more than 60,000 times, Nepute continues by rattling off a string of false and misleading claims related to COVID-19 — including about the delta variant, and certain mask and vaccine requirements. We fact-checked several of his claims. Referring to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that everyone in schools — regardless of vaccination status — use face masks, Nepute claims that it’s “all because of the quote unquote delta variant.” He claims that the variant “is not showing more deaths, it is not showing more of a problem — we are not seeing pediatric hospitals filled. They’re trying to scare you.” First of all, as we’ve explained , the delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is about twice as transmissible as the original versions of the virus. In July, it became the dominant strain in the U.S. and is now estimated to account for virtually all infections. Though, it’s unclear whether the variant, while more transmissible, actually causes more severe disease. The rise of delta has helped spur a significant spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S., and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are up significantly from early July, according to CDC data. It also prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend that even vaccinated individuals wear masks indoors in areas with substantial or high transmission of the coronavirus. Children do continue to comprise a very small portion of overall COVID-19 hospitalizations. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association estimated , based on data collected from 23 states and New York City, that as of Aug. 19 “children ranged from 1.6%-3.6% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.2%-1.9% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.” That said, the number of children being admitted to hospitals for the disease also has continued to increase since early July, CDC data show. The U.S. averaged 303 new daily hospital admissions for children with confirmed COVID-19 during the week of Aug. 16 to Aug. 22 — a new high. Total pediatric hospital admissions for COVID-19 reached a high of nearly 2,000 earlier this month. Some children’s hospitals have reported nearing capacity , with some officials citing COVID-19 cases as well as increased cases of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Dr. Roberta DeBiasi , division chief of infectious diseases at the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., told NPR that delta’s increased transmissibility was likely to blame for the larger volume of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in children. “If you have a larger number of cases overall and you apply that percentage, you’re going to see children hospitalized,” she said. “And that’s really the most important take home for families is that there’s nothing particularly more dangerous about the delta variant for children, but it has always remained a danger.” The AAP reported based on available state data that, as of Aug. 19, more than 180,000 COVID-19 cases in children “were added the past week, reaching levels of the previous winter surge of 2020-21.” “After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with over a four-fold increase the past month, rising from about 38,000 cases the week ending July 22nd to 180,000 the past week,” the organization said. In an Aug. 5 letter to the Food and Drug Administration regarding the need to vaccinate children against COVID-19, AAP President Lee Savio Beers wrote that the rise in cases showed that “the Delta variant has created a new and pressing risk to children and adolescents across this country, as it has also done for unvaccinated adults.” Later in his video, Nepute tells his viewers: “There was a news reporter in Texas that was misrepresenting the numbers in Texas hospitals for pediatric sicknesses and deaths. They’re trying to completely distract you.” It’s true that an Aug. 12 news report in the Texas Tribune erroneously reported the number of children recently hospitalized with COVID-19 in Texas. The original story mistakenly referred to the total number hospitalized since the pandemic began. But what Nepute doesn’t mention is that the newspaper corrected itself the same day, affixing a prominent correction at the top of its story online and notifying readers of the error.  Nepute also uses the video to argue against local mask mandates and vaccine requirements by distorting the facts about what federal officials are requiring of their own ranks. “When the truth is, the White House is not even mandating masks,” Nepute claims. “When the truth is that the CDC and the World Health Organization are not even mandating the vaccines. They’re not mandating these injections. And so why are they trying to mandate them on you when they’re not doing it for themselves?”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Hank Aaron’s Death Attributed to Natural Causes\". [/INST] Henry “Hank” Aaron, 86, “passed away peacefully in his sleep” on Jan. 22, according to a statement from the Atlanta Braves, the team for which he played 21 of his 23 seasons in Major League Baseball. He died more than two weeks after he publicly received his first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at a Morehouse Healthcare clinic on Jan. 5. That sequence of events has led some social media users to suggest there was a direct link between his getting the shot and then dying several days later. But there is no evidence that is the case. One person wrote on Facebook: “Our Brother Hank Aaron – RIP – wanted to be an example and an inspiration to Black People by taking the COVID-19 vaccine. Unfortunately, he may have become a clear example to Black People of why this vaccine CANNOT be trusted. … Two weeks after receiving his first Moderna shot, Hank Aaron died in his sleep. No cause of death is given, but you do the math.” Another Facebook user, who juxtaposed one news article about Aaron getting the vaccine and another about his subsequent death, wrote : “I hope people receive the message that this mans death should send to the rest of us!” And Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , a vaccine skeptic who has promoted COVID-19 misinformation , tweeted that “#HankAaron’s tragic death is part of a wave of suspicious deaths among elderly closely following administration of #COVID #vaccines.” Kennedy’s tweet linked to a post by his organization, the Children’s Health Defense, baselessly suggesting Aaron may have died as a result of the vaccine. While the exact cause of Aaron’s death has not been determined, health officials do not believe it was related to him being vaccinated. An official with the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s office, which examined Aaron’s body following his death, told FactCheck.org by phone that he died “due to natural causes.” In a statement emailed to AFP Fact Check , the county medical examiner, Karen Sullivan, said: “There was no information suggestive of an allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any substance which might be attributable to recent vaccine distribution.” She added: “In addition, examination of Mr. Aaron’s body did not suggest his death was due to any event other than that associated with his medical history.” WSB-TV in Atlanta reported that Aaron had a history of prostate issues and hypertension. In addition, he received treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee and used a wheelchair later in life. The Morehouse School of Medicine, which is affiliated with the Atlanta clinic where Aaron was immunized, also said the vaccine was not a factor in his death. The historically Black medical school emailed us a statement that said: “Mr. Aaron was a public health advocate and worked with us to help bridge the health equity gap in Atlanta and around the world. His passing was not related to the vaccine, nor did he experience any side effects from the immunization. He passed away peacefully in his sleep.” Aaron was among more than 20 civil and human rights activists — all over age 75 — who were vaccinated at the new health facility to “promote vaccine acceptance in the Black community,” the medical school said in a Jan. 5 press release. A December survey by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research had found that just 23% of Black Americans at the time said they definitely planned to get the coronavirus vaccine when it became available. That was much lower than the 53% of whites and 34% of Hispanics who said the same. On the day of his vaccination, Aaron told the Associated Press: “I don’t have any qualms about it at all, you know. I feel quite proud of myself for doing something like this. … It’s just a small thing that can help zillions of people in this country.” Andrew Young , the former congressman, mayor and U.S. ambassador, who also was vaccinated at the clinic the same day as Aaron, told Atlanta’s 11Alive that he was told Aaron “never had any reaction” to the shot prior to his death. “I talked to the fella who was his driver, and I said, ‘was Hank feeling any discomfort or any problem over the last few days?’ and he said, ‘no, he wanted to keep his schedule,'” the news station quoted Young as saying. As we have written, the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines both received emergency use authorizations from the Food and Drug Administration after being thoroughly tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials with thousands of participants. (For more, please see our SciCheck story, “ Q&A on COVID-19 Vaccines .”) On Jan. 22, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that after more than 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine were administered between Dec. 21, 2020, and Jan. 10, 2021, only 10 cases of anaphylaxis, or “a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction,” were found. “Nine of the 10 anaphylaxis case reports included a patient history of allergies or allergic reactions, including to drugs (six), contrast media (two), and foods (one); five patients had experienced an episode of anaphylaxis in the past, none of which was associated with receipt of a vaccine,” the CDC said. There have not been any reported anaphylaxis-related deaths. Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Two criminologists we checked with before publication warned us that such data may not be indicative of a real trend. In addition, while the preliminary data shows spikes in crime rates in some cities, Trump’s statement was broad, without qualifiers, and it came amid comments that painted an overarching image of a nation in decline.

But judging both by its design and by the rhetoric used to sell it, Roosevelt’s Social Security Act was targeted more at alleviating poverty among the elderly than at shaping the demographics of the labor market. Roosevelt said, \"The program for social security now pending before the Congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government. … It proposes, by means of old age pensions, to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.\" When we showed this statement to a couple of the historians we had originally interviewed, they acknowledged that it was an unusually clear statement on Roosevelt’s part, but they added that it is an exception within the documentary record. \"Promoting retirement was a minor goal at best of the old-age parts of the legislation,\" said University of California-Irvine sociologist Edwin Amenta.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Why It’s Easy to Misinterpret Numbers of Deaths Among the Vaccinated\". [/INST] Epidemiologists and biostatistics experts have been cautioning that as more and more of a population gets vaccinated, we’ll likely see more deaths from COVID-19 among the vaccinated. It’s simply math. The vaccines aren’t 100% effective — no vaccine is — so some deaths are expected. And if there are relatively few people still unvaccinated, the raw numbers of deaths are likely to show more deaths among the vaccinated. “Consider the hypothetical world where absolutely everyone had received a less than perfect vaccine. Although the death rate would be low, everyone who died would have been fully vaccinated,” David Spiegelhalter , chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, and Anthony Masters , statistical ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society, wrote in late June for a story published in the London-based Guardian . The headline on that piece: “Why most people who now die with Covid in England have had a vaccination.” Spiegelhalter and Masters cautioned: “Don’t think of this as a bad sign, it’s exactly what’s expected from an effective but imperfect jab.” Yet, months later, misleading social media posts are highlighting data from the U.K., suggesting the numbers of deaths show something is wrong. “BE IN THE KNOW: the vast majority of people (7 out of 10) who died from the COVID-19 virus in the UK were fully vaccinated,” one Facebook post reads, accompanied by a clip of Alex Berenson citing the data on “ The Joe Rogan Experience ” podcast on Oct. 12. Berenson, an author and former New York Times reporter, has been banned from Twitter for violating its rules on COVID-19 misinformation. We wrote about one of his tweets on the COVID-19 vaccines earlier this year. In the Facebook clip, Berenson correctly cites the U.K. numbers but presents them as something surprising. “And I have to keep saying this to people because they almost don’t believe it. In the U.K. 70-plus percent of the people who die now from COVID are fully vaccinated,” Berenson said. “It’s not a conspiracy theory. It’s not somebody saying, Oh, I heard this from my cousin. It’s in British government document from the U.K. Public Health England.” The 70% figure is correct. But again, those are raw numbers, among a highly vaccinated population. In its week 38 report , Public Health England — which has been replaced by the UK Health Security Agency — reported there were 3,158 deaths from COVID-19 from Aug. 23 through Sept. 19 and 2,284 of those individuals (72.3%) had received their second vaccine shot at least 14 days earlier. However, the same report shows vaccination rates approaching or exceeding 90% for age groups 60 and older, the group that accounts for 86.5% of all deaths in that time period. Overall, 77.3% of the U.K. population 12 and older had received two shots by Sept. 19. The same chart showing those death figures (see Table 4), shows the rates of death are higher among the unvaccinated than for the vaccinated. The death rate is calculated by comparing the number of deaths for vaccinated or unvaccinated people with the total population of each group. The death rates for the unvaccinated are three to five times higher than the rates for the vaccinated among the 60-and-over age groups."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"No New Revelation on Hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19\". [/INST] Researchers have studied whether the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine — pushed by then-President Donald Trump as early as March 2020 — is effective in treating COVID-19. But randomized controlled clinical trials, in which one group of patients is given the medication and another receives standard care, haven’t found a benefit in mortality or other clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. A randomized controlled trial is considered the “gold standard” in evaluating whether treatments are effective because it reduces bias by randomly assigning participants to treatment or standard care/placebo groups. Participants can be “blinded,” meaning they won’t know to which group they’re assigned. Researchers, who also can be blinded, can more confidently evaluate whether a treatment led to different effects. Data from such a trial, among other evidence, led the Food and Drug Administration in June 2020 to revoke an emergency use authorization it had issued three months earlier giving some patients easier access to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine if they couldn’t participate in a clinical trial. In revoking the EUA, the agency said the drugs, which are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, were “unlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19 for the authorized uses in the EUA.” The FDA said the “known and potential benefits” of the drugs “no longer outweigh” the risks. But a year later, in a June 12 statement, Trump said he was “right” about several things, including: “Hydroxychloroquine works.” No new randomized controlled trials have emerged to show that since we last looked at the research on the drug. The only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19 is the antiviral drug remdesivir , which the FDA approved in October for COVID-19 patients 12 years of age and older requiring hospitalization. Under its Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program , the FDA says it has reviewed more than 460 trials and that hundreds more drug development programs are being planned. As of late June, 11 drugs and biological products have emergency use authorization from the FDA for COVID-19 . As we noted, the FDA revoked its EUA for hydroxychloroquine. But social media posts have promoted Trump’s claim that the drug “works.” Other posts claim hydroxychloroquine would’ve made the vaccines unnecessary, and others falsely say that emails from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, show he was secretly telling a family member to take the drug along with an antibiotic. As we’ve written , Fauci’s emails, made publicly available thanks to journalists’ Freedom of Information Act requests, don’t show that. One person who wrote to Fauci said that about hydroxychloroquine. Conservative outlets, including One America News Network and Fox News, have recently publicized an observational study that hasn’t been peer-reviewed as having “confirmed hydroxychloroquine to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19,” as OAN put it. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, in a June 1 segment, called it a “landmark study” and asked one of the authors whether 100,000 American lives could’ve been saved throughout the pandemic if “people had an open mind about hydroxychloroquine.” The author, Dr. Stephen M. Smith, said: “I hate to say things like that. But, yes, I mean, the data — you know, I just try and look at the data.” But in an interview with FactCheck.org, Smith backed away from such a figure. “I don’t know how many deaths could’ve been prevented,” he said, adding that he didn’t know he would be asked that question during the Fox News segment. “Again where we failed was to really look at what was out there and to analyze it in a really constructive way,” Smith said. Experts who have studied hydroxychloroquine say Smith’s paper — which looked back at the treatment of 255 hospitalized patients requiring ventilation in March and April 2020 — has several flaws, particularly with the way the statistical analysis was done. And again, they point to the stronger evidence from randomized controlled trials. “Retrospective observational studies such as this cannot compare with the much larger randomized controlled trials which show unequivocally that HCQ is NOT beneficial in the treatment of hospitalised patients,” Nicholas White , a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Oxford’s Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health and Mahidol University in Thailand, told us in an email. White is helping to run a multinational randomized controlled trial on whether hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine is effective as a preventive to COVID-19. His trial is continuing, he said, adding that the question on whether the drugs can provide a benefit for early treatment or prevention “remains open.” Duke University’s Clinical Research Institute is leading another randomized clinical trial on whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19 among health care workers. The first two randomized controlled trials to announce their findings on hydroxychloroquine as a post-exposure prophylaxis did not find a benefit , including one trial from infectious disease specialist Dr. David Boulware and colleagues at the University of Minnesota. Boulware was also critical of Smith’s unpublished observational study. “This statistical analysis is completely invalid and therefore the conclusions are invalid,” he told us. The observational study was posted on a preprint website on May 31 . A preprint hasn’t been peer-reviewed, and the site says that while posting these unpublished papers can allow scientists to see and comment on findings, it also means the papers “have not been finalized by authors, might contain errors, and report information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community.” The study was authored by researchers at the Smith Center for Infectious Diseases & Urban Health, founded by Smith, and Saint Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey. In the past, Smith has been a proponent of hydroxychloroquine, telling Fox News in April 2020 that it was “a game-changer” and that he had been using it, along with the antibiotic azithromycin, to treat 72 COVID-19 patients. Dr. Neil Schluger , the Barbara and William Rosenthal Chair of the Department of Medicine at New York Medical College and director of medicine at Westchester Medical Center, told us the study “ wouldn’t get a passing grade in a beginning course in statistics in any school of public health in the United States,” and that he didn’t think it would survive peer review. Schluger co-authored a peer-reviewed observational study — published in the New England Journal of Medicine in May 2020 — on COVID-19 patients admitted to a hospital in New York. It found that “hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk” of death or intubation. It said randomized controlled trials of the drug were needed, and Schluger told us his study has since been superseded by such trials. Smith defended his study against the criticisms. He also said it was “simplistic” for some to claim that his study showed hydroxychloroquine alone was effective, saying that “the data don’t show” the drug “works.” Rather, he said it was the combination of hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin — with both drugs administered above a certain level — that was associated with “a big increase in survival” in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. He told us that because his study looked at the combination of the drugs, there were no randomized controlled studies with which to compare his observational study, except for a randomized controlled study from Brazil. He had several criticisms of that study. Two peer-reviewed, randomized controlled studies from Brazil looked at the impact of using hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin: One study focused on mild to moderate COVID-19 hospitalized patients, and the other enrolled patients with severe COVID-19. Both found the combination of the drugs didn’t improve clinical outcomes. “No trial is perfect,” Schluger told us, “but an RCT [randomized controlled trial] trumps a small retrospective study just about any day of the week.” Before we get to the recent preprint, let’s review what those gold standard randomized controlled trials have found regarding hydroxychloroquine."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Have Not Been Shown to Cause ‘Turbo Cancer’\". [/INST] COVID-19 has killed more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. People with cancer who get COVID-19 have an elevated risk of severe disease and death , especially those who have certain blood cancers . Vaccines help mitigate these risks . The COVID-19 vaccines can cause largely minor and short-lived side effects , such as fatigue and soreness at the injection site, which have been generally consistent in people with and without cancer. There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer for people who already have it. However, unsupported claims that the COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer have repeatedly surfaced on social media . “SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer,” recent posts have said . They claimed that a single mouse in this study “died suddenly,” a phrase associated with a family of groundless claims that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing large numbers of people. Sander Eens , a cardiovascular disease researcher at the University of Antwerp who co-authored the study in question, criticized how the social media posts characterized his work. “Specifically, our case report has been misinterpreted as evidence that Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 mRNA vaccine could cause a scientifically unrecognized phenomenon called ‘turbo-cancer,’” he told us in an email. “Turbo cancer” is a term used by people who claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and can cause particularly fast-growing cancer, but there isn’t evidence that this phenomenon is real. The recent study, published May 1 in Frontiers in Oncology, describes one mouse that died from lymphoma out of 14 mice that were given a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine delivered into their veins, which is not how the COVID-19 vaccines are given to people. The study does not show the mouse’s blood cancer was related to the vaccine. “Our case report in no way attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between the identified lymphoma and the mRNA vaccine,” Eens said. He added that he and his colleagues have now dosed 70 mice with the vaccine and have seen no further cases of any type of cancer. Dr. Jason D. Goldman , an infectious disease physician, clinical researcher and epidemiologist at Swedish Medical Center and the University of Washington, emphasized the difficulty of determining whether one event causes another. “You really can’t tell from a one-off if something has a causal relationship, meaning, does the vaccine cause the cancer? … Cancer happens, and when you vaccinate billions of people, of course many events are going to happen after the vaccines because that’s what happens and it would have happened anyway,” he said. “When we start seeing more patterns is when we think about causality.” So far, researchers have not seen a larger pattern. “Lastly, we would like to stress that COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy in the fight against the pandemic, and manifestations of serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare,” Eens told us. “To date, there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between mRNA vaccines and cancer development.” COVID-19 vaccines are injected into the muscle . Eens and his colleagues gave mice either a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or a placebo delivered directly into their bloodstream. The study was not meant to evaluate cancer in mice. Rather, the researchers were attempting to induce myocarditis, they explained in their paper , with the intent to use the mice to study this problem. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a rare serious side effect of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The mice generally did not experience adverse events, with the exception of the one mouse that died of B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma two days after its second vaccine dose. Lymphomas are cancers of immune cells originating in the lymphatic system. There are many different types of lymphoma and they come with a variety of possible treatments and prognoses in humans. Sanjay Mishra , coordinator of the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry and a researcher at Brown University, told us in an email that the particular type of mice used in the study “are predisposed to developing sarcomas and lymphomas, which is why they are used so frequently in neoplastic [cancer-related] studies.” He also said the “unusually high concentration” of vaccine delivered to the mice and the intravenous delivery were limitations of the work. Eens called his paper a “case report” and explained that these studies “are certainly not used to demonstrate causality (i.e., in this case between COVID-19 vaccination and the lymphoma).” Writing on his blog Respectful Insolence, surgical oncologist and researcher Dr. David Gorski said that it was highly unusual to even write a case report about a mouse — case reports are usually done to describe clinical cases in humans. Gorski also estimated that relative to their body weight, the mice got a vaccine dose that was hundreds of times greater than the dose adult humans get. And he said that the mouse likely already had cancer before ever being vaccinated, pointing out that it had already lost a large amount of weight before getting the first dose — a sign of preexisting disease. The COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials , which helped establish their more common side effects and did not show a link between the vaccines and cancer. Safety monitoring systems look out for further side effects once vaccines are broadly available. And although the initial COVID-19 vaccine trials did not include many people with cancer, researchers have subsequently studied safety in this group of people. “Whether original trials studied enough cases with lymphoma or not, there is no evidence since their roll-out that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” Mishra said. Pfizer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration told Lead Stories in response to questions about Eens’s study that their monitoring had not uncovered a causal link or safety signal related to cancer and COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists have raised theoretical concerns about a relationship between vaccination and lymphoma before, based on an association of some lymphomas with inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Vaccines “may overstimulate the immune system as well as trigger autoimmune responses,” Mishra said. Dr. Jeremy Warner , a physician focused on blood cancer and cancer informatics at Brown University, told us that “lymphomas are a very unusual family of cancers and I don’t want to pretend that we know everything about their etiology.” He said that inflammation-related lymphomas are often indolent , meaning they are slow-growing. Studies have mainly either found no association between vaccination and risk of lymphoma or have found a decreased risk. A 2022 study of 2,461 people with lymphoma and 2,253 people without lymphoma compared their history of vaccination for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, yellow fever and flu. The study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, did not find an increased risk of lymphoma in people who had been vaccinated and found that vaccination was in some cases associated with a lower risk of lymphoma. “COVID-19 vaccines should be no different than other vaccines, despite being of a different class,” Mishra said. Eens and his colleagues cited past case reports of lymphoma diagnosis, progression, regression or recurrence in humans after vaccination. These case reports describe a variety of types of lymphoma. As we have discussed, case reports can help guide hypotheses, but they are not meant to be definitive or show causal relationships. “Any observations in humans are most likely confusing correlation for causation,” Warner said. He added that “most people are getting vaccinated now, which means most new lymphoma diagnoses will occur in temporal relation to vaccination, whether or not they have anything to do with vaccination.” Some of the case reports describe lymphomas that developed on one side near the site of vaccination, but this is also not necessarily evidence that the vaccines caused the lymphomas. A study published earlier this year in Cancer Medicine illustrates this point. A group of German researchers decided to look into lymphoma and COVID-19 vaccination at two medical centers after they diagnosed lymphoma in the armpits of two patients. These lymphomas were found on the same sides where the patients had been vaccinated, in lymph nodes that could have received drainage from the deltoid region where the COVID-19 vaccines are generally given. But after analyzing 313 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the researchers found that lymphomas manifested on one side of the body in deltoid drainage lymph nodes at similar rates both before and after the COVID-19 vaccines became available. For patients diagnosed with lymphoma after vaccination, there was no association between the sides where the lymphomas appeared and where they got the shot. The CDC and various cancer-related organizations recommend that cancer patients get vaccinated against COVID-19. Some people with cancer, particularly those with certain blood cancers or receiving certain treatments, may have a weaker immune response to the vaccines. Even so, most patients have at least some benefit from vaccination. “Patients with hematologic malignancies are at greater risk of illness and mortality from COVID-19, so despite the limited immunological response of the vaccines, they are highly advised to get the vaccines and boosters,” Mishra said. “When we give vaccines to patients with lymphoma, we don’t see any turbocharging of the cancer clinically, and we do see protection sometimes from getting COVID at all, but more commonly from getting a serious form of COVID that could result in getting on a ventilator or death,” said Goldman, who specializes in treating immunocompromised patients in his work as an infectious disease doctor at Swedish Medical Center. The CDC recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get extra vaccine doses. This group includes people who have blood cancers associated with reduced vaccine response, as well as people with cancer who are currently in treatment."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"O.J. Simpson Died from Cancer, Not COVID-19 Vaccine\". [/INST] Conspiracy theorists and vaccine opponents quickly spun the death of O.J. Simpson into anti-vaccination fodder, even though his death was unrelated. Simpson , a football star who was acquitted in 1995 of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, died of cancer at age 76 on April 10, his family announced on social media the following day. Within hours of the announcement, posts began circulating online claiming that his death was related to his vaccination against COVID-19. Some of them advanced the widespread but false claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer.” “How’d that vaccine safety belt work out for ya OJ? #TurboCancer,” said one post on Instagram. Simpson received the COVID-19 vaccine shortly after it became available, sharing a picture of himself getting the shot in January 2021. He also advocated for others to get vaccinated. But there’s no link between COVID-19 vaccination and “turbo cancer,” which is a made-up term used by vaccine opponents online. There has been no link between the vaccines and any kind of cancer, for that matter, including prostate cancer, which is what Simpson reportedly had. We’ve written before about the false claim that COVID-19 vaccines cause “turbo cancer.” It’s worth noting that people who have cancer are at a heightened risk for severe disease and death from COVID-19, and the vaccines can offer protection. This tactic used by social media influencers to tie high-profile deaths, such as Simpson’s, to vaccination has been happening since the COVID-19 shots first rolled out. Here are some examples that we’ve written about before: Henry “Hank” Aaron — In the first full month that the vaccines were available, January 2021, baseball legend and civil rights activist Hank Aaron died. He died from natural causes, according to the medical examiner’s office in Fulton County, Georgia, and there was no evidence that his death was a result of being vaccinated against COVID-19. But claims falsely connecting his death to the shot swirled online. Betty White — The actress best known for her role in the television sitcom “The Golden Girls” died at age 99 on Dec. 31, 2021. White died of natural causes, according to her agent, but various falsehoods appeared on social media about White, including claims that she died after getting a COVID-19 booster shot. Doug Brignole — A 62-year-old bodybuilder who had heart disease died on Oct. 13, 2022, after contracting COVID-19. “Mr. Brignole’s underlying medical conditions, including heart disease from atherosclerosis would have made him less able to tolerate the effects of COVID-19, contributing to his death,” according to the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner’s report. But vaccine opponents falsely suggested that he died from the COVID-19 vaccine. He didn’t. He had been vaccinated 18 months before his death, and there was nothing linking his death to the vaccine. Jake Flint — The country singer died unexpectedly on Nov. 27, 2022, hours after his wedding. Social media posts baselessly suggested that Flint died because of the COVID-19 vaccine, but the 37-year-old singer received his second dose more than a year before his death. His representative said Flint’s death was “not related in any way” to the vaccine. Grant Wahl — Wahl, who was a sportswriter, died unexpectedly while covering the soccer World Cup in Qatar on Dec. 9, 2022. Purveyors of vaccine misinformation suggested that his death was caused by COVID-19 vaccination, but he died from the rupture of an aortic aneurysm that he didn’t know he had, his wife, Dr. Céline Gounder, wrote in a post on his Substack on Dec. 14, 2022. In fact, misinformation purveyors are so quick to try to tie any death to vaccination that, in one case, they declared a death that hadn’t even happened. When Damar Hamlin, a 24-year-old safety for the Buffalo Bills, collapsed on the field during a nationally televised game, conspiracy theorist Stew Peters suggested that Hamlin had “#DiedSuddenly,” a reference to the widespread, but completely unsupported conspiracy theory that COVID-19 vaccines are killing people in large numbers. As we’ve explained before , Hamlin said his doctors told him he suffered from a cardiac arrest caused by a blow to his chest. So, the use of Simpson’s high-profile death to perpetuate bogus anti-vaccination claims is nothing new."

[/INST]  Romney said it took the president 14 days before he called the Libya attack terror. In fact, Obama described it in those terms the day after the attack. But in the days that followed, neither he nor all the members of his administration spoke consistently on the subject. There were many suggestions that the attack was part of demonstrations over an American-made video that disparaged Islam. Update: After we published this item, we heard from readers that the president called the attack \"an act of terror\" two more times -- on Sept. 13 in Colorado and Sept. 14 in Nevada. \"As for the ones we lost last night: I want to assure you, we will bring their killers to justice,\" Obama said at a campaign event in Nevada. \"And we want to send a message all around the world -- anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America.\" So as we noted in our original item, Romney is off the mark as it relates to the word \"terror.\" But Obama contributed to the administration's mixed message when he spoke at the Univision Town Hall event on Sept. 20. A questioner asked: \"We have reports that the White House said today that the attacks in Libya were a terrorist attack. Do you have information indicating that it was Iran, or al Qaeda was behind organizing the protests?\" Here is Obama’s reply: \"Well, we’re still doing an investigation, and there are going to be different circumstances in different countries. And so I don’t want to speak to something until we have all the information. What we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\" So although Obama acknowledged the uncertainty, he emphasized the inflammatory video and the protest as contributing factors in the attack. By mentioning the video, Obama drew attention away from the possibility that the attack had been a planned assault. This lies at the heart of the dispute over what Obama and his administration were saying in the days after the attack. The president had the chance to be more complete and direct in Florida, but the administration was continuing to focus on the response to the video. Just four days earlier, Ambassador Rice downplayed the possibility that the attack was premeditated. The president’s words did not correct that impression.. ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Reduce Hospitalization and Death Rates, Contrary to Social Media Claims\". [/INST] Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey announced on Twitter on April 8 that he had tested positive for COVID-19. Pallone — who is 70 , which is in the age-range for an elevated risk for having a severe outcome — also wrote, “Thankfully, I’m vaccinated and double boosted so my symptoms are mild.” Shortly after that, Jenna Ellis , a lawyer who served on former President Donald Trump’s legal team, responded with a tweet that read: “Why are these idiots still THANKING the vaccine? Many people who were NOT vaccinated also experienced zero or mild symptoms. Stop pushing the vax.” She also posted screenshots of the tweets on Facebook and Instagram . This exchange captures the politicization of public health advice that has clouded the response to the pandemic from the beginning. We’ve written before about the differences in COVID-19 outcomes for those who are vaccinated and those who aren’t. Generally, those who have been vaccinated fare better. As the Mayo Clinic has explained , “fully vaccinated people with a breakthrough infection are less likely to have serious illness with COVID-19 than those who are unvaccinated. Even when vaccinated people develop symptoms, they tend to be less severe than those experienced by unvaccinated people.” Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show significantly higher rates of hospitalization for COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated compared with those who are fully vaccinated. For Pallone’s age-range, specifically — adults 65 and older — the rate of unvaccinated patients per 100,000 who were hospitalized was 79, while the rate for vaccinated patients was 15 for the week ending Feb. 26, the most recent week for which the CDC has published data. Those rates were down from a high of 481 and 55, respectively, when the omicron variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 peaked in January. Data presented to the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee on April 6 show that for immunocompetent adults 65 years old and above, those who received a booster dose had an 88% lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization than the unvaccinated four to six months later (see slide 25). Additionally, studies have shown that vaccines have been effective in preventing severe illness from COVID-19. A U.K. study in September found that, in cases of breakthrough infections, the odds of having no symptoms after the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine increased by 94%. “ Almost all symptoms were reported less frequently in infected vaccinated individuals than in infected unvaccinated individuals, and vaccinated participants were more likely to be completely asymptomatic, especially if they were 60 years or older,” the study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, found. Another study conducted in the U.S. and released in July found that the risk of a fever and the length of time for the illness were both lower in vaccinated COVID-19 patients compared to unvaccinated patients. “ Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world conditions, and the vaccines attenuated the viral RNA load, risk of febrile symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had breakthrough infection despite vaccination,” the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said. Both of those studies predated the recent omicron surge, though, and neither primary vaccination nor natural immunity was very effective in stopping infection against the omicron variant. However, booster doses of the vaccine did increase protection, according to preliminary research . So Ellis’ suggestion that there is little difference in outcomes from COVID-19 among the vaccinated and unvaccinated is wrong. Taking that claim even further, though, is a meme that’s been circulating on conservative social media accounts saying, “the unvaccinated aren’t dying.” That’s patently wrong. Similar to the rates of hospitalization for the unvaccinated compared to the vaccinated, data from the CDC shows that not only are unvaccinated people dying, they are dying at significantly higher rates than those who are vaccinated. For example, as omicron peaked in January, unvaccinated people aged 5 and older had a 9 times greater risk of dying than those who were vaccinated with at least the primary series of doses, according to the CDC . The risk of dying from COVID-19 was 21 times greater for unvaccinated people age 12 and older compared to those who were vaccinated with the primary series and a booster dose. Update, April 15: We updated this story to replace outdated information about the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines for those 65 and older.

There’s complexity to the speaker’s role in the passage of the 2004 tax increase for education, public safety and health programs. Howell consistently spoke out against the bill and voted against it. But the bill survived a hostile House committee because Howell persuaded four conservative allies to skip the vote. This was a political miscalculation by the speaker rather than a nod of support. Howell was under pressure to let the full House vote on the measure. He was outmaneuvered a week later when 17 Republicans joined Democrats to narrowly pass the tax hike.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Meme Spreads Falsehood About Vaccine Transfer Through Eating Meat\". [/INST] We’ve already explained why some earlier claims about COVID-19 vaccine transfer were false. But a new claim has emerged on Instagram suggesting that eating meat from animals vaccinated against COVID-19 could transfer the inoculation. The meme was first shared by an account that is selling a book titled “Detoxing The Rona Shot,” which is based on the false claim that the COVID-19 vaccines “put nano magnetic gene computers in everyone.” We’ve already addressed several other claims about microchips in the vaccines. The recent meme claims, “IF YOU ARE EATING FARM RAISED MEAT THE ANIMALS ARE BEING VAXXED SO U R VAXXED.” The account that posted it wrote in the comments, “In their mind they are protecting animals from a deadly disease. Animals get the alleged covid too. Vaccinating them is just protection.” First of all, livestock isn’t being vaccinated against COVID-19. “It’s simply not happening,” Dr. Suresh Kuchipudi , a clinical professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Penn State’s College of Agricultural Sciences, said in a phone interview. He knew of no countries that were vaccinating livestock for COVID-19. In the U.S., there are no COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in livestock and there are no federal recommendations that livestock should be vaccinated against COVID-19, Lyndsay Cole, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, told us in an email. APHIS regulates veterinary vaccines in the U.S., and it put out a call in November for COVID-19 vaccines that could be used in mink. Outbreaks of the disease on mink farms had been reported in multiple countries last year, including the U.S. , which caused concern since mink could act as a reservoir for the virus to mutate and then be passed back to humans as a new variant. In contrast to mink, which the World Organisation for Animal Health lists as highly susceptible to the virus that causes COVID-19, two of the major types of livestock in the U.S. — cattle and hogs — are listed as having “extremely low” susceptibility. Poultry is listed as having no susceptibility. The virus’ effect on animals continues to be studied , but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently says that the risk of spread from most animals is low. Following APHIS’ request in November, at least two U.S. companies — Zoetis and Medgene Labs — began developing vaccines that could be used in mink. Zoetis announced on July 2 that its vaccine had been authorized for experimental use on a case-by-case basis for various animals in some zoos and sanctuaries. The vaccine has not been fully licensed and is not commercially available, company spokeswoman Christina Lood told us in a phone interview. Medgene is still in the development phase of its vaccine, company spokesman Jason Melby told us in a phone interview. Both companies are pursuing a subunit type of vaccine , Lood and Melby said. That means that the vaccines are introducing a small, inactive piece of the virus that causes COVID-19 in order to trigger an immune response in the recipient. Russia also has reportedly developed a COVID-19 vaccine for animals, which was tested on dogs, cats, foxes and mink. It’s also worth noting that, according to a list of COVID-19 policies on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website, n o countries have implemented programs to vaccinate livestock against COVID-19. Beyond the fact that livestock and poultry aren’t getting the COVID-19 vaccine, experts we spoke to said that it wouldn’t be possible for the vaccine to be transmitted through consumption of meat, anyway. “These animals have always been given a lot of vaccines,” Kuchipudi said, and none of them pass on to those who eat the resulting meat. “That’s not how they transfer,” he said. That would be true for subunit vaccines, like the ones Zoetis and Medgene are developing, and for the mRNA vaccines that account for the majority of shots administered to people in the U.S., he said. The meme doesn’t specify which type of vaccine is supposedly being administered to livestock. “It just simply can’t happen,” John Wherry , chair of the department of systems pharmacology and translational therapeutics and director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Institute for Immunology at the Perelman School of Medicine, told us in a phone interview. “It doesn’t work that way.” Referring to the messenger RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer , Wherry explained that once the mRNA gets into a cell, it doesn’t propagate any further — meaning it doesn’t spread from one cell to another. And as we’ve explained before , the mRNA passes on instructions to make antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19, then is quickly broken down and leaves the body. “Even if you ate” the vaccine, Wherry said, it wouldn’t work. It would be doubly impossible to get the vaccine from meat, he said, since cooking it would inactivate the RNA. Gary Whittaker , professor of virology at Cornell University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, agreed. He told us in an email that, in his view, it would be impossible for an mRNA vaccine to be transmitted through meat consumption. “The RNA is just too unstable to survive – hence the need for all the freezers for the vaccine,” he wrote. Addressing how other types of vaccines may behave if they were given to livestock, Whittaker wrote, “An adenovirus-vaccine (J+J/AstraZeneca) would be more stable, but still extremely unlikely to survive processing. A live attenuated-vaccine (not currently used) could theoretically survive, at least until the meat is cooked – but in this case there are way bigger risks associated with eating raw meat!” Although COVID-19 vaccines aren’t being given to livestock, as Penn State’s Kuchipudi said, a number of vaccines are commonly given to poultry and livestock for other viruses. And there are already rules in place for how much time must pass between when a vaccine is given and when an animal is slaughtered, often referred to as the withdrawal time. This withdrawal period “ensures the end product is safe for consumption and no medication would be present in the beef,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association explained in a Q&A at the beginning of the pandemic. Simply put, the claim that vaccines can be transferred by eating meat “doesn’t make any scientific sense,” Wherry said.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Moderna CEO’s Remarks on Vaccine Production\". [/INST] The first COVID-19 cases were identified in China in December 2019. In March 2020, after the coronavirus had spread around the world, the biotech company Moderna was ready to begin the first human tests of its vaccine. The Moderna vaccine is made of modified messenger RNA, or mRNA, which temporarily prompts human cells to make one piece of the coronavirus — its surface spike protein. The immune system responds to the spike proteins, generating antibodies and activating other immune cells that then protect against the virus. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Moderna vaccine for emergency use in December 2020, a week after granting authorization to a similar mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, as we’ve written. The two companies were able to quickly develop mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 because researchers already knew from past experience with other coronaviruses that the virus uses the spike protein to enter cells and cause infection. As early as 2019, Moderna had been working on an investigational mRNA vaccine to protect against MERS, another disease caused by a coronavirus. When the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, became available in January 2020, the company began work on an mRNA vaccine to target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moderna announced on Feb. 24, 2020, that it had released the first batch of its COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, for human use. The vials were sent to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for use in clinical trials. In January at the World Economic Forum, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel, while explaining the company’s manufacturing capacity, told a panel that Moderna’s total production was “100,000 dose” in 2019. He was referring to the number of doses of its vaccines and therapeutics for all uses, not to the COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna had not yet begun production of that vaccine. But social media posts misrepresented Bancel’s remarks, falsely claiming that he said the company was making the vaccine before the pandemic was recognized. “URGENT — Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel Admits Company Produced 100,000 COVID-19 Doses in 2019 Before The Pandemic Started,” read an Instagram post on Feb. 9. Another Instagram post shared on Feb. 12 repeated that claim, linking to a brief clip of Bancel’s remarks at the WEF. “Did they predict the pandemic?” read the caption. A spokesman for Moderna told us the social media posts were “inaccurate.” Bancel was referring to “the approximate total doses in 2019 (across vaccines and therapeutics) for cancer, rare diseases etc. Entire portfolio,” Moderna spokesman Christopher Ridley said in a Feb. 14 email. “We received the COVID-19 sequence on Jan. 10, 2020, which started our COVID work,” Ridley said. The full discussion of the WEF panel on Jan. 18 in Davos, Switzerland, titled “State of the Pandemic,” is available on the WEF website. (Bancel’s comments are about 10 minutes into the 46-minute video.) Bancel, the former CEO of the French diagnostics company BioMérieux, was asked to comment on the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development and the “scaling” to address different variants and subvariants. He responded, “So the great news versus 2020, where we are today is we are at manufacturing capacity.” He went on to say, “When the pandemic happened, Moderna had made 100,000 dose in 2019 for the whole year.” Bancel then said he remembered walking into a manufacturing head’s office and asking, “I say, how [do] we make a billion dose next year? And they look at me a bit funny, and say, what? I say, yeah, we need to make a billion dose next year, there’s going to be a pandemic.” Bancel said something similar at an American Heart Association event in November 2021, when he said Moderna made fewer than 100,000 doses of any vaccine in 2019 and was on track to ship as many as 800 million doses in 2021."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Tucker Carlson Misrepresents Vaccine Safety Reporting Data\". [/INST] More than 266 million COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the U.S. and most of the reported side effects have been minor . But Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested to his 3.3 million viewers on May 6 that more than 3,000 people have died from the COVID-19 vaccines. “The actual number is almost certainly higher than that,” he said. “Perhaps vastly higher than that.” Social media posts then spread this claim further. But the claim is based on a misrepresentation of data collected by federal agencies that use it to identify potential safety issues with vaccines. The system that collects the data is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS , and anyone can submit a report, even if it’s not clear that a vaccine caused the problem . We took a look at the details in some of the cases reported in the VAERS system. For example, one case that was included in Carlson’s count was for an 85-year-old senior home resident who died on Dec. 29. This was what was reported to VAERS: “My grandmother died a few hours after receiving the moderna covid vaccine booster 1. While I don?t expect that the events are related, the treating hospital did not acknowledge this and I wanted to be sure a report was made.” Another report included in Carlson’s count was for a woman who was vaccinated on Jan. 9, had a car accident two weeks later, and died with a brain hemorrhage nine days after that. Another report was for a 17-year-old who killed himself with a gun eight days after he was vaccinated. This doesn’t mean that no deaths could be related to the vaccines. But these examples make it clear that “VAERS accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine,” as the Department of Health and Human Services explains . Doctors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration review every case of death as soon as it is reported to VAERS. As we said, the CDC and FDA use the database to detect patterns of potential vaccine-related adverse events, which is what happened in April when regulators flagged reports of rare instances of blood clots in women under 50 who had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The agencies then recommended pausing distribution of the vaccine to investigate the rare and dangerous clotting condition. When they recommended resuming its use, the agencies a warning for women under 50. As of May 11, according to the CDC , more than 9 million doses of the J&J vaccine had been given, and there were 28 confirmed reports of the clotting syndrome. The CDC has said that its review of the information in those cases “has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines. However, recent reports indicate a plausible causal relationship between the J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event — blood clots with low platelets — which has caused deaths.” The bottom line is that it’s wrong to suggest that reported deaths in the VAERS database were all caused by vaccines. That’s not the case. We’ve written before about similar falsehoods that misrepresent the information in VAERS. In his case, though, Carlson took that misrepresentation further. He suggested that the already inflated number of deaths is even higher. “A report submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in 2010 concluded that ‘fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported by the VAERS system,'” he said. “Fewer than 1%. So what is the real number of people who apparently have been killed or injured by the vaccines?” But that report — which analyzed the use of an automated system for tracking health changes following vaccination rather than relying on the current system of purely voluntary reports — didn’t explain how it calculated that percentage and, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, the degree of underreporting in VAERS varies widely depending on the severity of the symptoms. “‘Underreporting’ is one of the main limitations of passive surveillance systems, including VAERS,” HHS says on its website. The department then gives the example of injection-site soreness, which is one of the most common events to follow vaccination, but represents few of the reports to VAERS. “On the other hand, more serious and unexpected medical events are probably more likely to be reported than minor ones, especially when they occur soon after vaccination, even if they may be coincidental and related to other causes,” the site says . A recent study by CDC scientists also found that reporting to VAERS was relatively high for some of the more serious events that can follow vaccination, such as anaphylaxis and Guillain-Barre Syndrome . “VAERS sensitivity for capturing anaphylaxis after seven different vaccines ranged from 13 to 76%; sensitivity for capturing GBS after three different vaccines ranged from 12 to 64%,” the study found. Carlson also injected some conspiratorial thinking into his segment, saying, “Some people say, ‘well it’s just a coincidence that someone gets a shot and then dies, possibly from other causes.’ No one really knows, is the truth.” Actually, the point of the VAERS system is to alert federal agencies to potential problems so they can investigate. For reported deaths, HHS says CDC and FDA doctors in each case review “available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records.” A Fox spokeswoman we talked to declined to answer whether or not Carlson has been vaccinated against COVID-19.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Flawed Analysis of New Zealand Data Doesn’t Show COVID-19 Vaccines Killed Millions\". [/INST] Numerous studies have found the COVID-19 vaccines are quite safe, with only a few rare serious side effects. There’s nothing to support the notion that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing large numbers of people, as some people online have claimed for years. Despite the lack of evidence, the claims remain popular, revived periodically by various pseudoscientific analyses . Most recently, Steve Kirsch, a tech entrepreneur who has become a major source of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, has claimed that leaked data from the New Zealand government “prove” that the vaccines have killed on average 1 person for every 1,000 doses — or when extrapolated to the entire world, about 13 million people. “There is no possible way that this data is consistent with a safe vaccine,” Kirsch wrote in his Substack. Experts say this is wrong. Even if the underlying data are accurate, they can’t be used to make causal claims about the vaccines, Jeffrey S. Morris , director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told us. On top of that, he said, Kirsch’s methods are flawed and based on invalid assumptions — and his interpretations run counter to existing evidence. “His methodology is extremely ad hoc and arbitrary and wrong in very specific ways,” Morris said of Kirsch. Kirsch debuted his claims in a Nov. 30 presentation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his alma mater, where he had been invited to speak by a student group. He also shared them in a Substack post, which has been shared on social media. Others have picked up his claims or circulated related claims about the New Zealand data online. A database administrator employed by Te Whatu Ora, or Health New Zealand, illegally gave Kirsch the underlying data he uses in his analysis. On Nov. 30, the worker appeared in a video with Liz Gunn, a New Zealander known for spreading conspiracy theories and her opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine, discussing the vaccine database information and making claims similar to Kirsch’s. Soon after, the employee, a man named Barry Young, was arrested and charged for his role in the data breach, according to the New Zealand Herald. Te Whatu Ora said in a statement that there is “no evidence whatsoever that vaccination is responsible for excess mortality in New Zealand,” adding that Young has “no clinical background or expert vaccine knowledge” and that “[w]hat he is claiming is completely wrong and ill-informed and his comments demonstrate this.” Te Whatu Ora was also granted an injunction to remove any database information that remains online to protect people’s privacy. In his Substack, Kirsch had posted the data, which he said had been anonymized, and encouraged others to download it to perform their own analyses. In some cases, people who have done so have had their file hosting accounts suspended . Kirsch and others have tried to spin the arrest of the database administrator and subsequent removal of the data as evidence of government efforts to hide “the truth.” But Morris said Kirsch was downplaying legitimate legal issues. “It’s a very serious thing to share identified data,” he said, adding that the information given to Kirsch “had the birth dates of the individuals, the dates they got their vaccines, the dates they died, which could uniquely identify every single person.” Kirsch has argued that his sharing of the data is not a problem because it was anonymized, but it’s not necessarily clear yet whether the data contains any identifying information. Morris said he would have performed and presented his own analysis of the data, but did not feel comfortable doing so because of potential legal and privacy concerns. There are multiple problems with Kirsch’s analysis that Morris and others have noted, as we’ll explain in more detail below. And tellingly, even many people who have spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines before and believe the vaccines are killing people have pushed back on Kirsch’s claims. But Morris also suggested looking at excess death graphs for New Zealand and other countries just to see whether Kirsch’s claims pass a basic sniff test — and they do not. In much of the world, spikes in excess deaths closely correspond to when countries experienced COVID-19 deaths. There is no evidence that millions of people died from the vaccines. New Zealand is a little different in that during much of the pandemic, the country actually had a deficit of deaths, likely due to the mitigation measures the island took and the success the nation had in keeping the coronavirus out. Those measures may have also reduced flu deaths and other kinds of deaths. But there, too, the only real period of excess deaths occurs during the two waves of COVID-19 New Zealand experienced in March and August 2022, a year or so after vaccination began. Some excess deaths in 2022 could also be a kind of catch-up, Morris said, from older people who avoided dying in 2020 and 2021. Regardless, the pattern is clear, Morris said, and part of what happened in 2022 in New Zealand was a return to a baseline level of death after a couple of years of fewer deaths. “What he’s saying is implausible,” Morris said of Kirsch. According to his description, Kirsch’s analysis consists of what he calls a “time-series cohort analysis” of “record-level data” from 4 million out of the 12 million COVID-19 vaccine doses given in New Zealand. These doses, he says, were part of a pay-per-dose program in the country, which he claims were randomly administered. Kirsch uses the data to plot death rates from any cause over time since vaccination, claiming that if the vaccine is safe, the graph should level off and be flat or decline three weeks after vaccination. If it’s not, he says, any increase reflects deaths caused by the vaccine. Using this flawed logic, he then calculates a death rate for all ages of 1 death per 1,000 doses, which he applies globally to arrive at his 13 million estimate of the number of people killed by the vaccines, and an estimate of 675,000 for the U.S. There are numerous problems with this approach. To start, Morris said many of Kirsch’s assumptions are simply not true. “There’s nothing in the literature that says, oh, these plots should be completely flat. And if they’re not flat, the only explanation can be that the vaccine is causing death,” he said. “There’s no such thing.” In theory, Morris said, the curve for a “safe vaccine” would be flat if there’s a constant death rate that never varies throughout the year, and if the decision to get vaccinated or additional doses is completely random. But that’s not the situation with real data. So in fact, Morris said, there are many reasons why a curve might increase, even if a vaccine is not killing people. Susan Oliver, an Australian scientist who corrects misinformation, similarly explained in a YouTube video critiquing Kirsch’s claims that such curves are not expected to be flat for seasonal vaccines. “The reason for this is because deaths [due to any reason] don’t occur uniformly throughout the year,” she said. “They follow a seasonal trend with higher deaths in the winter months.” The same could be true during a pandemic if many people are vaccinated around the same time, and then COVID-19 restrictions are lifted and a COVID-19 wave hits, as occurred in New Zealand. Or, as also happened in New Zealand, an abnormally low mortality rate rebounded to a normal level after a period of intense COVID-19 restrictions. Kirsch has simply claimed that the vaccination records he has represent a random sample of the 12 million doses given in New Zealand. But he provides no evidence that this is true, instead arguing that others have to prove him wrong, incorrectly reversing the burden of proof. There is little public information about the pay-per-dose program, and Te Whatu Ora told us it could not provide further comment given the ongoing investigation and injunctions. However, it appears the pay-per-dose system was for reimbursing providers such as primary care practices, which would have been separate from mass vaccination clinics, for example. It is hardly clear that the populations served by both groups would be identical. And in any case, there remain important differences between the populations that get a different number of doses. Additionally, while Kirsch is aware of what’s called the healthy vaccinee effect — a phenomenon in which, especially at first, vaccinated people will have an artificially lower rate of death than the overall population because very sick people would not be getting vaccinated — Morris said Kirsch arbitrarily decided that it ends after exactly three weeks. There’s no basis for that, he said. Kirsch then uses the rate of death at three weeks as the baseline for death and counts all deaths above that as excess deaths caused by the vaccines. Again, Morris said it’s invalid to just assume that all excess deaths would be vaccine-caused — but also, the baseline may be completely incorrect. Morris suspects that this is the case, noting that while Kirsch’s main analysis misleadingly focuses on all ages and all doses, when the rising death rates only exist for older people, one would really need to break the data down by age and by dose, and then use actuarial data for each age group to get some idea of an accurate baseline. The baseline Kirsch uses is much too low, he said. The entire “increase” in deaths could simply be a recovery back to the actual baseline. “He hasn’t ruled that out at all,” Morris said of Kirsch. This gets at another fundamental problem with Kirsch’s analysis: the lack of an unvaccinated group. Kirsch claims this isn’t needed for his type of analysis, but as Morris told us, Kirsch has no idea how the death rates in vaccinated or unvaccinated people compare. “When you don’t even have the unvaccinated, then you have no calibration point because it’s possible that whatever you’re looking at in the vaccinated, it’s possible that their death rate is lower than the unvaccinated across the board,” Morris said. “So if that’s the case, how can you argue that the vaccine is killing people on the basis of this data?” Indeed, while Kirsch presents his analysis as iron-clad proof that the vaccines have killed millions of people, it’s incorrect to even say that this data could provide that degree of certainty. “The data that he got, even if it’s fully legitimate and accurate, cannot be used to answer the question that he wants to answer about causal effects of vaccines on death,” Morris said. Kirsch also hypes the data, misleadingly claiming that “[n]o State or country has ever released record-level public health data on any vaccine” and casting his analysis as special. Morris said that in fact, while no one else uses the term “record-level data,” such information has been used in numerous COVID-19 vaccination studies around the world, which have turned up no evidence of mass vaccine-related death. But unlike in Kirsch’s case, those researchers have a legal right to use the data, and the raw data are not shared because of privacy reasons. In addition, Morris said, that data usually include information on confounders, or other variables that might be associated with an outcome of interest such as death — precisely the data that would help make a causal connection, but something that is lacking in Kirsch’s dataset. Clarification, Dec. 15: We updated the story to clarify Morris’ comment about not performing his own analysis of the New Zealand data."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Tucker Carlson Misleads on COVID-19 Vaccines, Masks\". [/INST] All of the authorized COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease. In phase 3 trials, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines had an efficacy of 94% or higher , which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by 94% or more if you are fully vaccinated. In real-world conditions, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in March found the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective in preventing infections — not just symptomatic cases. Johnson & Johnson’s phase 3 trial reported an efficacy of 72% in preventing moderate to severe disease in the U.S. and 85.9% efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease. The CDC, however, recommends that for now fully vaccinated people should wear masks in public for several reasons, including a stubbornly high rate of infection , concern about variants and the need for m ore research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make unvaccinated people sick. Notwithstanding the data, Fox News host Tucker Carlson baselessly casts doubt on the effectiveness of the vaccines by claiming “people in charge are acting like it doesn’t work,” citing the fact that President Joe Biden wears a mask even though he has been vaccinated. Carlson made his remarks April 14 on “ Tucker Carlson Tonight .” A four-minute segment from that show — which included a chyron that said “Fauci Should Be Able to Answer Simple Questions” — was posted to the “Tucker Carlson Tonight” Facebook page. Carlson repeated several versions of the same question over and over, even though Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has answered this “most basic of all questions.” As we have written , it is important not to confuse the virus, SARS-CoV-2, with the disease that it causes, COVID-19. The vaccines protect against COVID-19, which is the disease caused by the coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the vaccinated person may not experience symptoms. Fauci explained this in a Dec. 10 interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo before the arrival in the U.S. of the first case a SARS-CoV-2 variant. He did so again more recently at a White House briefing on April 12 and at a House oversight committee hearing on April 15. At the hearing, Fauci said vaccinated people are not expected to show any symptoms and science needs to conduct more research on whether asymptomatic vaccinated people can make other unvaccinated people sick. Fauci said there is another issue to be concerned about and that is the circulation of coronavirus variants — the first of which was discovered in the U.S. on Jan. 25 in a traveler returning to Minnesota from Brazil. “We want to make sure that if you have full protection against one type of a virus that a variant might come along that might escape the protection. So if you want full protection and you are out in the community where there’s a lot of virus out there, that’s why we still recommend wearing a mask,” he said. “And in answer to question before, when you get the level of virus really low, all of that is going to go away and you are not going to have any–very, very little risk therefore people will not have to wear a mask.” This is why both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris wear masks even though they’ve been vaccinated. As Biden explained in a Dec. 3 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, they’re setting an example for the public. “It is important that we, in fact, the president and the vice president, we set the pattern by wearing masks,” Biden said . Also before he took office, Biden announced his plan for a “100-day challenge” aimed at slowing the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. It included an appeal for all Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his administration as well as administering 100 million shots in the same timeframe. Two weeks ahead of that deadline, more than 200 million vaccines have been administered in the U.S., about 190 million of which were given since Biden took office . As for the call to wear masks, the first executive order that Biden signed required those on federal property to wear masks. On his second day in office, Biden signed an executive order requiring masks on public transportation. We’re still in Biden’s first 100 days, which ends on April 30. In guidance issued on April 2, the CDC said fully vaccinated people can meet indoors without masks or social distancing with other fully vaccinated people and can have such visits with unvaccinated people who are at low-risk of contracting severe COVID-19 (if the unvaccinated people are from a single household). But the fully vaccinated should wear masks and remain physically distanced from when visiting unvaccinated people from more than one household or in public settings. “When you are in the home — you are vaccinated people — or you have a child, and a grandmother, grandfather, whoever it is — as long as they’re in good shape, you don’t have to wear a mask,” Fauci said at the April 12 White House briefing. “But once you go out into that big bad world out there, where there are a lot of infections going on — 80,000 new infections in one day — that there is an issue there that you’ve got to be careful with.” At the hearing, Fauci directly responded to Carlson’s false implication that vaccines don’t work. “The implication was since you’re asking us to wear masks, the vaccine might not be working,” he said. “My comment to that is that the vaccines were shown, the mRNA vaccines, to be between 94 and 95 percent effective. So my answer to him is merely one of data. Look at the data. The vaccines are highly efficacious and have been shown in the field to be highly effective.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"False Claim About Cause of Autism Highlighted on Pennsylvania Senate Panel\". [/INST] Evidence has shown that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine commonly given to children isn’t related to the development of autism. Rather, autism is understood to be caused by a combination of factors — some genetic and some environmental — although the disorder is still being studied. The environmental factors that can increase the risk of autism include advanced age of either parent and complications during birth, according to recent research. Vaccination is not a contributing factor. But the false claim about vaccination and autism has been circulating since 1998, when a since-retracted paper wrongly suggested the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. Data presented in the paper were later found to be fabricated . The General Medical Council in the United Kingdom stripped the lead author of his ability to practice medicine for his dishonesty and irresponsibility in the paper. But the baseless claim has remained. It was recently repeated on a “ medical freedom panel ” hosted by Doug Mastriano — a Pennsylvania state senator who has made dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines. Among those on his June 9 panel was Steve Kirsch , an entrepreneur who is not a doctor or medical expert. Kirsch referenced the well-worn falsehood linking the MMR vaccine to autism, but broadened it to suggest that vaccines, generally, cause a host of ailments as well as gender dysphoria and homosexuality. He told legislators , “The Amish are a perfect example of a large group of people who are largely unvaccinated and there’s no autism — we can’t find an autistic kid who was unvaccinated. It’s very, very rare. In the Amish community — very, very rare. You won’t find transsexuals. You won’t find homosexuals. You won’t find kids with ADD, with autoimmune disease, with PANDAS/PANS, with epilepsy. You just don’t find any of these chronic diseases in the Amish.” Clips from this portion of the panel are now circulating on social media . Since Kirsch has also repeated the specific claim about MMR vaccines, we’ll first address his claim that “we can’t find an autistic kid who was unvaccinated.” Studies have shown that the rate of autism present in children who were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella compared with those who were never vaccinated is the same. A 2019 paper found that children who were given the MMR vaccine were diagnosed with autism at about the same rate as those who weren’t. That study “strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination,” its authors wrote. As early as 2004, there was already evidence that vaccines did not cause autism. An Immunization Safety Review Committee’s report published that year by the National Academy of Sciences concluded “that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.” Many studies since then have also shown similar findings. So, Kirsch need only look to those studies to find examples of unvaccinated children who developed autism. His suggestion that the disorder is less common among unvaccinated children is wrong. As for Kirsch’s claim that in addition to autism, gender dysphoria, homosexuality, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autoimmune diseases, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections ( PANDAS ) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome ( PANS ), and epilepsy are virtually nonexistent among the Amish because they are unvaccinated — that’s not right, either. First of all, Kirsch makes the unsupported assumption that the Amish community is “largely unvaccinated.” It’s hard to know what the vaccination rate is among the Amish community as a whole because there is no data available on that. But research on some Amish groups has shown that children are vaccinated. One paper from 2017 that studied an Amish community in northern Ohio found that 98% of the parents surveyed had immunized their children in whole or in part. Another paper from 2011 found that, of the parents surveyed, 85% had vaccinated at least some of their children. Also, it’s worth noting that a 2010 conference paper studied autism among the Amish, specifically, which shows that the disorder does exist within that community. The paper said, “Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order.” That rate was lower than the general population, the paper noted, but that could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in how caregivers answered screening questions or genetic differences. Even if autism is less common among the Amish, there is no evidence that it has anything to do with vaccination — and indeed, numerous studies contradict such an interpretation. Second, on the suggestion that vaccines cause people to become “transsexuals,” as Kirsch said — we’ve written before about the similar false claim that standard childhood vaccination causes gender dysphoria , which is the distress felt by some transgender individuals since their sex assigned at birth doesn’t match their gender identity. There’s also no evidence to support the claim that vaccination is responsible for causing heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality, either. But Kirsch isn’t the first to make the claim. QAnon conspiracy theorists in 2021 spread the claim that vaccines could make children homosexual after an Iranian cleric with a history of spreading fake COVID-19 cures — Abbas Tabrizian — posted about it on Telegram. Kirsch’s suggestion that various ailments are caused by vaccines is similarly unsupported by evidence. For example, his suggestion that “ADD” — or attention-deficit disorder, which is the old name for what is now called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD — is a result of vaccines is also wrong. There have been three large studies that have examined the risk that vaccines could cause ADHD. In particular, two of those studies looked at the effect of a preservative called thimerosal. Anti-vaccine campaigners have pointed to thimerosal as the trigger for various diseases — including both autism and ADHD — even though it hasn’t been included in childhood vaccines since 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All three of those studies found that there was no association between vaccination and ADHD. “Therefore, parents can be reassured that vaccines do not cause ADHD or related conditions,” the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia wrote in a post explaining the issue. Kirsch didn’t offer any support for his claims during his panel appearance, and we were unable to find any research suggesting that vaccines are responsible for any of the conditions that he listed."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misrepresent Ruling on COVID-19 School Mandate Lawsuit\". [/INST] The Los Angeles Unified School District was among the employers that mandated COVID-19 vaccination in 2021, and then faced lawsuits over its requirement. The first suit, filed on March 17, 2021, was brought by employees who didn’t want to get vaccinated. It was dismissed four months later because the school district had amended its policy to allow workers to instead submit to regular testing. (The district later reinstituted the vaccine requirement without the testing option, and then did away with the mandate altogether in September .) A second suit was brought in November 2021 on behalf of the district employees by an Idaho-based nonprofit that started in 2020 and has pursued several lawsuits directed at public health measures meant to curb the spread of COVID-19, including mask and vaccine mandates. The nonprofit organization, called the Health Freedom Defense Fund, argued that COVID-19 vaccines are not actually vaccines, but are instead “medical treatments,” and cannot be mandated. The group argued that the COVID-19 vaccines don’t prevent transmission of the disease, but rather just reduce its severity in those who are infected – making “the injection … a treatment, not a vaccine.” As we’ve explained before , since the virus changes as it spreads, the vaccines have become less effective in providing protection against symptomatic illness, but it is effective in preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in February found that, for adults, the most recent formulation of the vaccines provided 54% increased protection against symptomatic infection. Experts say that those vaccines should also be effective in preventing severe disease and death from the most common variants circulating since 2023. Although the legal fight against the LA school district has been going on for about three years, it’s still in a relatively early legal stage, since both cases have been dismissed by trial courts. The Health Freedom Defense Fund suit was dismissed for several reasons in 2022, most importantly because the court found that the vaccine’s ability to reduce the severity of disease and death from COVID-19 met the district’s interest in protecting the health of students and employees. However, on June 7, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that dismissal and sent the case back to the trial court to flesh out the arguments on both sides. But conspiracy theorists and anti-vaccination influencers on social media have misrepresented the opinion from the appeals court to falsely claim that it had “declared that the mRNA covid jab is NOT a vaccine.” The court did no such thing. Rather, the three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the lower court was wrong to dismiss the case and that the school district’s “pattern of withdrawing and then reinstating its vaccination policies was enough to keep this case alive.” As we said, the case is still in the early stages and neither side has presented much beyond their initial arguments. The appeals court wrote, “At this stage, we must accept Plaintiffs’ allegations that the vaccine does not prevent the spread of COVID-19 as true.” Letting the case continue will allow for each side to present evidence to support their arguments about the effectiveness of the vaccines. “We note the preliminary nature of our holding,” the court said. “We do not prejudge whether, on a more developed factual record, Plaintiffs’ allegations will prove true.” So, the court found that the case should continue. It has not “declared” whether or not the COVID-19 vaccines are actually vaccines."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Twist Meaning of CDC, FDA Disclosure on Bivalent Booster\". [/INST] Most of the systems set up to detect early signs of potential problems with the COVID-19 vaccines haven’t given any indication that the bivalent booster from Pfizer/BioNTech may correspond with a certain type of stroke in those 65 and older. But one system did. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration issued an explainer on Jan. 13 reporting that the Vaccine Safety Datalink — a real-time monitoring system that the CDC has used since 1990 — had “met the statistical criteria to prompt additional investigation into whether there was a safety concern for ischemic stroke in people ages 65 and older who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent.” The CDC and FDA also explained: “Although the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD represents a true clinical risk, we believe it is important to share this information with the public,” the CDC and FDA wrote in the explainer. Despite all the context offered by the CDC and FDA and the fact that the similarly formulated COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna wasn’t flagged, anti-vaccine campaigners took the announcement and used it to wrongly suggest that the agencies had found a causal link between the booster and strokes. Dr. Simone Gold , who has frequently spread misinformation about COVID-19 treatments, wrote in a Twitter thread about the announcement: “We’ve know the truth for a while. We’ve warned the public about the potential dangers associated with experimental biological agents. The public health officials who marketed these vaccines as ‘completely safe’ while censoring dissenting voices have blood on their hands.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who leads the anti-vaccination organization Children’s Health Defense, took a similar approach, referencing the accumulation of claims from anti-vaccination campaigners since the shots became available as though they were correct.  “Alarming new information from the CDC + FDA that everyone else has known for almost two years,” he wrote on Twitter . And conspiracy theorist Stew Peters took it even further, claiming on Rumble that the “CDC ADMITS Vaxx Causes Strokes.” But, as is clear from the explainer that publicly disclosed the potential problem, the CDC has not identified any kind of causal link. The extent of its finding is that data collected through the VSD indicated that researchers should investigate whether or not those who are 65 or older may be at risk of having an ischemic stroke in the first few weeks following a booster dose with the Pfizer bivalent vaccine. The system’s flag was based on comparing the risk for stroke in the 21 days following vaccination with days 22-42 following vaccination. An ischemic stroke happens when a vessel that brings blood to the brain is obstructed, usually by fatty deposits on vessel walls and blood clots , according to the American Stroke Association. This type of stroke accounts for more than 80% of all strokes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The VSD found that out of about 550,000 people who were 65 or older, 130 had strokes within three weeks of getting the shot, according to reporting in the Washington Post . None of those who had a stroke died. “Often these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself,” the statement disclosing the potential issue said. Safety monitoring systems like VSD are designed to catch a wide array of potential signals so that researchers can assess whether health agencies should change their recommendations. We’ve written about examples similar to this one , where systems detected a potential issue and researchers found little or no evidence that the vaccines were causing the problem. We’ve also written about examples where safety monitoring systems detected a problem that researchers found was likely related to a vaccine, as in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can cause a particular kind of clotting that also involves low levels of blood platelets. The condition is very rare, and the CDC has recommended the two mRNA vaccines over J&J’s, which has accounted for only a small percentage of the vaccine doses administered in the U.S. As the Washington Post article noted, officials are skeptical that there’s a safety risk here because there’s no reason that this kind of problem would arise now, considering the large number of vaccines administered globally over the last two years, and there’s also no reason that it would be present in only the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and not in the similar one from Moderna. The fact that public health officials could detect a potential issue associated with the vaccines, though, shows that the system is working. But, in this case, it didn’t warrant a change in recommendations for the vaccines, which have been effective in preventing serious illness from COVID-19 and, studies have shown , can actually reduce the risk of stroke after infection with the virus that causes COVID-19."

[/INST] In his first address to Congress on April 28, President Joe Biden spent about five minutes laying out a new part of his economic recovery plan, which focuses on education, child care and paid leave. That proposal, called the American Families Plan , follows two related proposals — the American Rescue Plan , a COVID-19 stimulus package that Biden signed into law on March 11, and the American Jobs Plan , which focuses largely on infrastructure and is awaiting action by Congress. In his speech, Biden said that the new proposal would allow for up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. He added , “No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones — a parent, or spouse, or child.” But a video clip has been circulating on social media that includes only the first part of the president’s statement, making it sound like he said, “No one should have to choose between a job and a paycheck.” The same truncated quote also has been featured in memes and tweets , which garnered comments suggesting that the president was proposing a plan that would keep people “ fully dependent on the government.” But, as the full video shows, Biden was talking about a program that would offer up to 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents and those who are taking care of an ailing family member.  According to a White House fact sheet , “The program will ensure workers receive partial wage replacement to take time to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill loved one, deal with a loved one’s military deployment, find safety from sexual assault, stalking, or domestic violence, heal from their own serious illness, or take time to deal with the death of a loved one. It will guarantee twelve weeks of paid parental, family, and personal illness/safe leave by year 10 of the program, and also ensure workers get three days of bereavement leave per year starting in year one. The program will provide workers up to $4,000 a month, with a minimum of two-thirds of average weekly wages replaced, rising to 80 percent for the lowest wage workers.” That’s just the administration’s initial vision for the plan. It is likely to change as it works its way through Congress. Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

After 7 million deaths recorded internationally from the disease, Tedros declared “COVID-19 over as a global health emergency” on May 5, 2023. But the WHO continues to advise countries “to work towards vaccinating at least 70% of their populations [against COVID-19], prioritizing the vaccination of 100% of health workers and 100% of the most vulnerable groups, including people who are over 60 years of age and those who are immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions.” Yet an Instagram user shares a post on X from conservative radio host Stew Peters that misleadingly claims, “TEDROS SAYS HE ISNT VACCINATED.” Peters has spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 in the past, as we’ve written . Peters’ post on Sept. 12 shows an edited clip of an interview with Tedros from a 2022 HBO documentary, “How to Survive a Pandemic.” In the clip, Tedros is asked by Science magazine writer Jon Cohen when he was first vaccinated against COVID-19. Tedros is then heard saying: “I feel like I know where I belong — in a poor country called Ethiopia, in a poor continent called Africa, and wanted to wait until Africa and other countries, in other regions, low-income countries, start vaccination. So I was protesting, in other words, because we’re failing.” In other words, Tedros delayed getting a COVID-19 vaccine as a protest against the failure of vaccination efforts in African countries. In the full interview with Cohen, published in Science on June 18, 2021, Tedros responded to Cohen’s question by saying he had received his first vaccination on May 12, 2021. Tedros tweeted a photo of himself that day getting that vaccine, writing, “Today it was my turn to get vaccinated. …  Vaccines save lives.” About 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally, but only a little more than 35% of the population in Tedros’ home country of Ethiopia have received the primary series, according to Our World in Data."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Vaccines Have Not Been Shown to Cause ‘Turbo Cancer’\". [/INST] COVID-19 has killed more than 1.1 million people in the U.S. People with cancer who get COVID-19 have an elevated risk of severe disease and death , especially those who have certain blood cancers . Vaccines help mitigate these risks . The COVID-19 vaccines can cause largely minor and short-lived side effects , such as fatigue and soreness at the injection site, which have been generally consistent in people with and without cancer. There isn’t evidence to date that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer or lead to worsening cancer for people who already have it. However, unsupported claims that the COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer have repeatedly surfaced on social media . “SHOCKING: New Study proves Pfizer mRNA induced turbo cancer,” recent posts have said . They claimed that a single mouse in this study “died suddenly,” a phrase associated with a family of groundless claims that the COVID-19 vaccines are killing large numbers of people. Sander Eens , a cardiovascular disease researcher at the University of Antwerp who co-authored the study in question, criticized how the social media posts characterized his work. “Specifically, our case report has been misinterpreted as evidence that Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 mRNA vaccine could cause a scientifically unrecognized phenomenon called ‘turbo-cancer,’” he told us in an email. “Turbo cancer” is a term used by people who claim that the COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous and can cause particularly fast-growing cancer, but there isn’t evidence that this phenomenon is real. The recent study, published May 1 in Frontiers in Oncology, describes one mouse that died from lymphoma out of 14 mice that were given a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine delivered into their veins, which is not how the COVID-19 vaccines are given to people. The study does not show the mouse’s blood cancer was related to the vaccine. “Our case report in no way attempts to demonstrate a causal relationship between the identified lymphoma and the mRNA vaccine,” Eens said. He added that he and his colleagues have now dosed 70 mice with the vaccine and have seen no further cases of any type of cancer. Dr. Jason D. Goldman , an infectious disease physician, clinical researcher and epidemiologist at Swedish Medical Center and the University of Washington, emphasized the difficulty of determining whether one event causes another. “You really can’t tell from a one-off if something has a causal relationship, meaning, does the vaccine cause the cancer? … Cancer happens, and when you vaccinate billions of people, of course many events are going to happen after the vaccines because that’s what happens and it would have happened anyway,” he said. “When we start seeing more patterns is when we think about causality.” So far, researchers have not seen a larger pattern. “Lastly, we would like to stress that COVID-19 vaccines have demonstrated exceptional safety and efficacy in the fight against the pandemic, and manifestations of serious adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare,” Eens told us. “To date, there is no scientific evidence of a causal link between mRNA vaccines and cancer development.” COVID-19 vaccines are injected into the muscle . Eens and his colleagues gave mice either a high dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or a placebo delivered directly into their bloodstream. The study was not meant to evaluate cancer in mice. Rather, the researchers were attempting to induce myocarditis, they explained in their paper , with the intent to use the mice to study this problem. Myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, is a rare serious side effect of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The mice generally did not experience adverse events, with the exception of the one mouse that died of B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma two days after its second vaccine dose. Lymphomas are cancers of immune cells originating in the lymphatic system. There are many different types of lymphoma and they come with a variety of possible treatments and prognoses in humans. Sanjay Mishra , coordinator of the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry and a researcher at Brown University, told us in an email that the particular type of mice used in the study “are predisposed to developing sarcomas and lymphomas, which is why they are used so frequently in neoplastic [cancer-related] studies.” He also said the “unusually high concentration” of vaccine delivered to the mice and the intravenous delivery were limitations of the work. Eens called his paper a “case report” and explained that these studies “are certainly not used to demonstrate causality (i.e., in this case between COVID-19 vaccination and the lymphoma).” Writing on his blog Respectful Insolence, surgical oncologist and researcher Dr. David Gorski said that it was highly unusual to even write a case report about a mouse — case reports are usually done to describe clinical cases in humans. Gorski also estimated that relative to their body weight, the mice got a vaccine dose that was hundreds of times greater than the dose adult humans get. And he said that the mouse likely already had cancer before ever being vaccinated, pointing out that it had already lost a large amount of weight before getting the first dose — a sign of preexisting disease. The COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials , which helped establish their more common side effects and did not show a link between the vaccines and cancer. Safety monitoring systems look out for further side effects once vaccines are broadly available. And although the initial COVID-19 vaccine trials did not include many people with cancer, researchers have subsequently studied safety in this group of people. “Whether original trials studied enough cases with lymphoma or not, there is no evidence since their roll-out that COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer, lead to recurrence, or lead to disease progression,” Mishra said. Pfizer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration told Lead Stories in response to questions about Eens’s study that their monitoring had not uncovered a causal link or safety signal related to cancer and COVID-19 vaccines. Scientists have raised theoretical concerns about a relationship between vaccination and lymphoma before, based on an association of some lymphomas with inflammation and autoimmune conditions. Vaccines “may overstimulate the immune system as well as trigger autoimmune responses,” Mishra said. Dr. Jeremy Warner , a physician focused on blood cancer and cancer informatics at Brown University, told us that “lymphomas are a very unusual family of cancers and I don’t want to pretend that we know everything about their etiology.” He said that inflammation-related lymphomas are often indolent , meaning they are slow-growing. Studies have mainly either found no association between vaccination and risk of lymphoma or have found a decreased risk. A 2022 study of 2,461 people with lymphoma and 2,253 people without lymphoma compared their history of vaccination for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, yellow fever and flu. The study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, did not find an increased risk of lymphoma in people who had been vaccinated and found that vaccination was in some cases associated with a lower risk of lymphoma. “COVID-19 vaccines should be no different than other vaccines, despite being of a different class,” Mishra said. Eens and his colleagues cited past case reports of lymphoma diagnosis, progression, regression or recurrence in humans after vaccination. These case reports describe a variety of types of lymphoma. As we have discussed, case reports can help guide hypotheses, but they are not meant to be definitive or show causal relationships. “Any observations in humans are most likely confusing correlation for causation,” Warner said. He added that “most people are getting vaccinated now, which means most new lymphoma diagnoses will occur in temporal relation to vaccination, whether or not they have anything to do with vaccination.” Some of the case reports describe lymphomas that developed on one side near the site of vaccination, but this is also not necessarily evidence that the vaccines caused the lymphomas. A study published earlier this year in Cancer Medicine illustrates this point. A group of German researchers decided to look into lymphoma and COVID-19 vaccination at two medical centers after they diagnosed lymphoma in the armpits of two patients. These lymphomas were found on the same sides where the patients had been vaccinated, in lymph nodes that could have received drainage from the deltoid region where the COVID-19 vaccines are generally given. But after analyzing 313 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the researchers found that lymphomas manifested on one side of the body in deltoid drainage lymph nodes at similar rates both before and after the COVID-19 vaccines became available. For patients diagnosed with lymphoma after vaccination, there was no association between the sides where the lymphomas appeared and where they got the shot. The CDC and various cancer-related organizations recommend that cancer patients get vaccinated against COVID-19. Some people with cancer, particularly those with certain blood cancers or receiving certain treatments, may have a weaker immune response to the vaccines. Even so, most patients have at least some benefit from vaccination. “Patients with hematologic malignancies are at greater risk of illness and mortality from COVID-19, so despite the limited immunological response of the vaccines, they are highly advised to get the vaccines and boosters,” Mishra said. “When we give vaccines to patients with lymphoma, we don’t see any turbocharging of the cancer clinically, and we do see protection sometimes from getting COVID at all, but more commonly from getting a serious form of COVID that could result in getting on a ventilator or death,” said Goldman, who specializes in treating immunocompromised patients in his work as an infectious disease doctor at Swedish Medical Center. The CDC recommends that people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised get extra vaccine doses. This group includes people who have blood cancers associated with reduced vaccine response, as well as people with cancer who are currently in treatment."

[/INST] Responding to efforts by Republican-controlled legislatures around the country to tighten voting regulations in their states, Democrats in Congress are seeking to expand voter access in federal elections nationwide. H.R. 1, dubbed the For the People Act by its sponsors, has been passed by the House, but Senate Republicans have blocked a vote on the measure. As we’ve reported, Republicans have made misleading claims or issued statements lacking context in attacking H.R. 1. Social media posts have also misrepresented the contents of the bill, as we’ve written . A post now spreading on Facebook falsely claims that the measure would prevent states from deleting the names of dead people from voter rolls. It reads: “DEMS OPPOSE GOP MOVE TO REMOVE DEAD PEOPLE FROM VOTER ROLLS. THEY CLAIM THAT WOULD BE VOTER SUPPRESSION. ARE THESE PEOPLE PLAYING WITH A FULL DECK?” Rep. Elise Stefanik, of New York, the chair of the House Republican Conference, made a similar claim in a March 3 tweet . Stefanik misleadingly asserted that H.R. 1 would, among other things, “Prevent removal of ineligible voters from registration rolls.” Stefanik’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Current legislation, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act , already requires states to try to remove the names of dead people from voter rolls. The law “ requires States to conduct a general voter registration list maintenance program that makes a reasonable effort to remove ineligible persons from the voter rolls by reason of the person’s death, or a change in the residence of the registrant outside of the jurisdiction, in accordance with procedures set forth in the NVRA.” What is new is that H.R. 1 seeks to prevent purging eligible voters from election rolls by requiring states to obtain “objective and reliable” evidence before notifying a person that they have been removed from the rolls. The bill says three things cannot be considered as evidence: The failure of the registrant to vote in any election; the failure of a registrant to respond to any notice unless the notice has been returned as undeliverable; and the failure of a registrant to take any other action with respect to voting or their status as a registrant. Death is an exception, and none of that needs to be considered to remove a deceased person’s name from a voting list. Aside from death, the main reason for removing a voter from the rolls is that they have moved out of the jurisdiction where they were registered. “I’ve never seen a Democratic proposal that would restrict the ability to remove voters who have died from the rolls, and the [National Voter Registration Act] expressly authorizes and requires them to do that,” David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research , told us in an email. “Election officials of both parties want to remove dead voters from the lists, but they also want to make sure they don’t accidentally remove voters who haven’t died.” Becker said in a separate phone interview that the biggest innovation since the 1993 law was the creation of the Election Registration Information Center , or ERIC, a non-profit corporation that helps election officials in 30 states and the District of Columbia to keep their rolls up to date by identifying voters who have moved or died. Becker said ERIC was responsible for “much more accurate voter lists in 2020 than there ever have been in American history.” Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Post Misleads on COVID-19 Death Reporting, Vaccine Monitoring\". [/INST] COVID-19 is dangerous: The disease is estimated to have caused more than 579,000 deaths in the U.S. alone, and it can cause lingering health problems for some who get it. The COVID-19 vaccines now authorized for emergency use in the U.S., meanwhile, were found in clinical trials to be safe and effective at preventing symptomatic illness. Nearly 250 million doses have been administered thus far. But a post circulating online distorts the facts to imply that COVID-19 deaths are inflated by a supposed mandate concerning positive COVID-19 tests. It also baselessly suggests that vaccines are causing deaths that are being ignored.  “Funny isn’t it, if you die within 20 days of testing positive for the Rona (no matter what other factors were involved) You’ll be counted as a COVID death,” the May 2 tweet reads. “However, if you drop dead within 24 hours of taking the vaccine it has nothing to do with it.” One Instagram post of a screenshot of the tweet garnered more than 32,000 likes. Another earned more than 8,000 likes. But there is no rule that those who “die within 20 days of testing positive” for COVID-19 are to be automatically classified as having died from the disease, “no matter what other factors were involved.” We’ve previously addressed similar false claims surrounding COVID-19 death certificates and have explained that there is no federal law governing the death certificate process. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does provide guidance on certifying deaths, including some specific to COVID-19. The CDC specifically advises that “COVID-19 should not be reported on the death certificate if it did not cause or contribute to the death.” And there is no evidence that any state or local agencies have such a 20-day rule, either. It’s possible that COVID-19 could be listed as a contributing factor to — but not the underlying cause of — a death in some cases. But at least 90% of death certificates citing COVID-19 to date list the disease as the underlying cause, or the illness that triggered the chain of events leading to the person’s death, according to CDC data available as of May 5. It’s worth noting, in the context of the baseless implication that COVID-19 deaths are being systematically misreported, that excess death estimates further reinforce the toll of the pandemic. From March 2020 through the start of 2021, the U.S. experienced about 20% more deaths than would have been expected in the same time period, analyses show . The estimates are higher than the official COVID-19 death toll for that period; excess mortality can also capture indirect effects of the pandemic, such as people who may have died from other causes because they avoided seeking medical attention. The tweet’s suggestion that COVID-19 vaccines are causing deaths that are not being investigated also doesn’t carry weight. The U.S. government has several monitoring systems in place to track reports of adverse events — including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System . Patients and caregivers are asked to report “any clinically important medical event or health problem that occurs after vaccination” to VAERS, even if they’re not sure if it was a result of the vaccine. The CDC and Food and Drug Administration review each case report of deaths that follow vaccination to determine whether they were caused by the vaccine. There has not been an established link for the overwhelming majority of the reports. The FDA’s fact sheet for health care providers administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine now says that “a causal relationship” between the vaccine and rare cases involving both blood clots and low blood platelets “is plausible” based on the evidence available. The monitoring systems were used to identify those cases. As of May 4, there were 23 confirmed reports of people developing the condition after receiving the J&J vaccine, and at least three individuals have died. More than 8.4 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered. Federal officials on April 13 recommended a brief pause on the J&J vaccine while the issue was investigated and, 10 days later, lifted the pause — saying that the “known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.” Both the FDA and CDC now include warnings about the rare risk. The CDC says that “[w]omen younger than 50 years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event” with the J&J vaccine, and that other COVID-19 vaccines are “available for which this risk has not been seen.” So health officials do probe reports of adverse events that follow vaccinations, including deaths, contrary to the tweet’s suggestion. “ CDC Recommends Use of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Resume .” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[/INST] Efforts to ban or censor books are intensifying in the U.S., targeting titles on school shelves and in public libraries, according to data released in September by the American Library Association and PEN America. The ALA said that between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, the association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom found “695 attempts to censor library materials and services and documented challenges to 1,915 unique titles. The number of unique titles challenged has increased by 20 percent from the same reporting period in 2022.” “Most of the challenges were to books written by or about a person of color or a member of the LGBTQIA+ community,” the ALA report also said. PEN America , which advocates free expression for writers, reported that during the 2022–23 school year, the organization “recorded 3,362 instances of books banned [in schools], an increase of 33 percent from the 2021–22 school year.” “Over 40 percent of all book bans occurred in school districts in Florida. Across 33 school districts, PEN America recorded 1,406 book ban cases in Florida, followed by 625 bans in Texas, 333 bans in Missouri, 281 bans in Utah, and 186 bans in Pennsylvania,” the organization reported. Amid increased censorship and book bans in those states, some social media posts are sharing a video that enflames those concerns in the state of Missouri. The posts show two men using flamethrowers on a large bonfire, but the posts falsely report what is being burned. The headline on one of the posts inaccurately claims, “Republican state senators in Missouri participate in ‘book burning’ with flame throwers.” The caption on another post falsely claims, “Republican Missouri Gubernatorial Candidate and State Senator Bill Eigel along with Missouri State Senator Nick Schroer participated in a book burning this weekend using flame throwers at an event called the St. Charles County Freedom Fest.” It is true that State Sens. William Eigel and Nick Schroer are shown enthusiastically using flamethrowers on a growing blaze, while other people cheer and record the event on their phones. But the senators were burning empty cardboard boxes. The flamethrowers were being auctioned off at a Republican fundraising event called Freedom Fest in St. Charles County, Missouri, and the senators were demonstrating their use, festival planner Debbie McFarland told the Associated Press. The claim that books were being burned at the event is “an absolute fabrication,” McFarland said. Schroer responded to the claims of book burning with a post on X on Sept. 17, which said, in part, “these were two items being raffled off and myself and @BillEigel burned a stack of empty boxes to help increase the funds being raised.” Eigel posted on X on Sept. 18 a video taken from another angle that more clearly shows they were burning empty boxes. “In the video, I am taking a flame thrower to cardboard boxes representing what I am going to do to the leftist policies and RINO corruption of the Jeff City swamp,” Eigel wrote on the post, referring to the state capital in Jefferson City. However, Eigel, who is running for governor in 2024, also wrote on X on Sept. 18, “But let’s be clear, you bring those woke pornographic books to Missouri schools to try to brainwash our kids, and I’ll burn those too — on the front lawn of the governor’s mansion.” We tried to reach Schroer and Eigel for comment about the claims on social media, but we didn’t hear back. It’s worth noting that in August 2022, Missouri passed a law, SB 775 , that bans school libraries from providing students with books that contain “explicit sexual material,” though it has exceptions for books of “serious artistic significance, or works of anthropological significance, or materials used in science courses.” Librarians and school officials face up to a year in jail or a $2,000 fine for violating the law. School districts have removed hundreds of titles , temporarily or permanently, as a result of the state law, Education Week reported. In February, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, representing the Missouri Association of School Librarians and the Missouri Library Association, filed a suit in circuit court in Kansas City challenging the law as unconstitutional."

Furthermore, the threat of losing Title IX funds was real enough to convince authorities in Illinois and California to comply. In the end, it largely comes down to politics. The two judges who have ruled against transgender students are Republican political appointees. The federal departments of education and justice, which typically support transgender students, are run by Democratic political appointees. McCrory is right that a judge said there shouldn’t be a threat to Title IX funding in these types of situations.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Vaccines Remain Largely Effective Against Delta Variant, Counter to Claims From Fox News Guest\". [/INST] Update, Aug. 23, 2021: The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, received full approval from the agency on Aug. 23 for people 16 years of age and older. Update, Feb. 10, 2022: The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA on Jan. 31 for individuals 18 years of age and older. The highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus now accounts for 82% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is partly responsible for the rising number of infections across the vast majority of the country. Data show that while the authorized COVID-19 vaccines may be less protective against delta in preventing infections and symptomatic illness compared with earlier versions of SARS-CoV-2, they still largely remain effective — and are very good at preventing serious disease and death. As CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a July 16 press briefing , “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” as outbreaks continue in places with low vaccination rates. But that’s not the message Fox News guest Dr. Peter McCullough has been spreading. In a July 13 interview on “The Ingraham Angle,” the private practice internist played down the risks of the delta variant and falsely said there was “no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.” “We are at a very low baseline now,” he said in reply to host Laura Ingraham, who asked him what to expect next from the pandemic. “We are going to have a slight rise with the delta variant, but the delta variant really is not responsive at all, or protected at all by the vaccines. So 42% of 90,000 proven delta cases in the U.K. have been vaccinated. In Israel, the estimate right now from the Israel health authorities that the vaccine efficacy rate is only about 60 to 70%. So we expect delta cases and in fully vaccinated individuals. It will be a mild rise. It’s easily treatable in high-risk patients. There is no reason right now, no clinical reason to go get vaccinated.” As we’ll explain, McCullough, who has previously been a source of COVID-19 misinformation , including about vaccines, is correct about the Israeli percentage, but wrong about the U.K. one — and there is an abundance of data contradicting his claim that the vaccines do nothing against the delta variant. As for the idea that COVID-19 is “easily treatable,” there is little to support that notion as well, especially with hundreds of Americans still dying every day from the disease. “You’re much, much better off being vaccinated than not,” Frederic Bushman , co-director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens , told us. “The delta variant may reduce the effectiveness [of the vaccines] a little, but still they’re so effective that you get a lot of benefit.” Scientists don’t have information from the clinical trials about how well the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines perform against the delta variant because the phase 3 trials were done at a time before the variant was circulating widely. The variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India in October 2020 and is more than twice as transmissible as the original versions of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. Some data also suggest delta may cause more severe disease, but this has not been conclusively established. There are, however, multiple studies of how the vaccines are faring in the real-world against delta, and most show the vaccines are working largely as expected. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine on July 21 by Public Health England, for example, found that after the two recommended doses, the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in preventing symptomatic disease in the U.K. fell only slightly, to 88.0% against delta from 93.7% against the alpha variant — another more contagious version of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, that previously predominated in the country. The authors, however, noted that a larger decline and lower effectiveness was observed after a single dose, underscoring the importance of receiving both immunizations. In an unpublished study that has not yet been peer reviewed, the U.K. health agency also found the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was very effective at preventing hospitalization with the delta variant, reducing the risk by 94% after one dose and by 96% after two. Other countries have reported similar preliminary results. In an unpublished study from Ontario, Canada, researchers estimated the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against symptomatic infection with delta to be 87% after two doses, while a report from Scotland, published in the British medical journal the Lancet , pegged the figure at 79% for infection with delta. The Canadian report also found that one dose of the Moderna vaccine was 70% effective in preventing symptomatic disease and 95% effective in preventing hospitalization or death; there were too few COVID-19 cases among the vaccinated to estimate the effectiveness after two doses. Meanwhile, in Israel, the health ministry released preliminary, unpublished information on July 5 suggesting that with the rise of the delta variant in the nation, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was now 64% effective against infection or symptomatic illness, but still 93% effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization. The ministry had previously estimated the vaccine to be 97% effective against symptomatic disease, with similar levels of protection against hospitalization and death, at a time when the alpha variant made up the vast majority of COVID-19 cases. McCullough, therefore, is right that Israel estimated the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine effectiveness at “only about 60 to 70%.” But that is still a substantial amount of protection — and McCullough neglects to mention the vaccine’s excellent ability to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19. In late July, the ministry further reduced its vaccine effectiveness estimate for symptomatic COVID-19 to 40.5%, but once again, found protection against severe disease to remain robust — 88.0% effective against hospitalization and 91.4% effective against severe COVID-19. It’s worth mentioning that some experts doubt the accuracy of the Israeli estimates, which are outliers compared with the other results and rely on a different methodology. In its July 27 scientific brief on the vaccines, the CDC said “more technical information is needed to allow full interpretation.” The most recent Israeli figure, in particular, is based on a small number of cases over a short period of time and should be considered preliminary, according to an expert advising the Israeli government on the coronavirus. The ministry itself also acknowledged the results might be skewed because of differential testing among the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Make Unfounded Claims About Political Affiliation of John Wilkes Booth\". [/INST] President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by the actor John Wilkes Booth , a Confederate sympathizer and white supremacist . E nraged by Lincoln’s last public address, in which the president said he planned to grant some African-American men the right to vote , Booth — who had already been planning with other Confederates to abduct Lincoln — shot and killed the president at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., on April 14, 1865. But posts on social media misrepresent Booth’s political affiliation, claiming without evidence that he was a Democrat when he shot the Republican president. A viral Facebook post shared by conservative meme page The Rabbit Hole shows an illustration depicting the moment before Booth fired on Lincoln. “WHEN DEMOCRATS DON’T GET THEIR WAY, THEY GET DANGEROUS,” the meme reads. The post has received more than 1,800 likes and 750 shares. A post on Twitter also claims, “Liberals are criminals and most criminals, every mass shooter, and Presidential assassin since John Wilkes Booth was a Democrat.” Another post on Twitter reads, “If the #Democrat John Wilkes Booth, killed #Republican President Lincoln today, #FakeNews and Dems would call it a ‘#PeacefulProtest'”! But we could find no basis for the claims that Booth was a Democrat. “ To my knowledge, there are no surviving statements in which John Wilkes Booth declares he is a Democrat, but merely saying so oversimplifies his politics,” Christian McWhirter , the Lincoln historian at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, told us in an email. “ He certainly was not a Republican and his politics during the Civil War were almost entirely motivated by his belief in white supremacy and intense hatred of Abraham Lincoln. Booth viewed Lincoln and the Republicans as responsible for the Civil War because he considered them a ‘radical’ abolitionist party who forced the slaveholding states to secede to protect the institution of slavery,” McWhirter said. “ Booth’s political affiliations before the Civil War are a little murkier but he appears to have been a ‘Know-Nothing’ in the 1850s,” McWhirter continued. “This was a third party movement — known officially as the American Party — that for a time competed with the Republicans as the major second party replacing the collapsed Whig Party. The core of the Know-Nothing platform was opposition to immigration from various non-Anglo-Saxon groups, such as the Irish and Germans, along with Catholics.” In “Assassins: Killers Who Changed History,” the editors of TIME-LIFE say that Booth “developed extreme political convictions as a teen and joined the Know Nothing party, reactionaries bent on preserving America for native-born whites.” In addition to his affiliation with the Know-Nothing Party , Booth was with the militia group the Richmond Grays in 1859 when they served as guards during the execution of John Brown, the abolitionist who led the Raid on Harper’s Ferry. During the Civil War, Booth worked as a Confederate spy and courier as part of the Confederate Secret Service , according to William A. Tidwell, a retired brigadier general and coauthor of a book on the Confederate Secret Service. In a personal diary entry and a letter intended for his brother-in-law, John Clarke, Booth explained his motives, saying he believed that Lincoln’s policies would ruin America. “Our country owed all her troubles to him, and God simply made me the instrument of his punishment. The country is not what it was. This forced union is not what I have loved,” he wrote in a diary while on the run shortly after shooting Lincoln . “This country was formed for the white, not for the black man,” Booth wrote in a letter to Clarke . “And looking upon African slavery from the same standpoint held by those noble framers of our Constitution, I for one have ever considered it one of the greatest blessings (both for themselves and us) that God ever bestowed upon a favored nation… Yet Heaven knows no one would be willing to do more for the negro race than I, could I but see a way to still better their condition. But Lincoln’s policy is only preparing the way for their total annihilation…” McWhirter said that Booth’s hatred of Lincoln and the Republicans intensified as the Civil War went on, adding that Booth “viewed their wartime measures as increasingly tyrannical.” “Booth was further enraged by Republican efforts to destroy slavery. As a committed white supremacist, Booth believed African Americans could only function in American society as enslaved people and this was a significant factor in his eventual decision to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, especially after Lincoln suggested possibly granting some Black men the right to vote in his final public speech on April 11, 1865, which Booth attended,” McWhirter said. “ I don’t think we know how or if he voted in 1860 or 1864, so it’s possible he voted for a Democratic candidate in those elections due to his opposition to Republicans,” McWhirter also said, “but I can’t say for sure unless there is a document out there I’m not aware of.” Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Herbal Recipes for Abortion Are Unproven and Can Be Dangerous, Contrary to Social Media Posts\". [/INST] After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 24 — dismantling federal protection of the right to an abortion — posts began spreading online with home remedies and herbal concoctions that would purportedly cause a “miscarriage.” Many of the posts — which are circulating on major platforms, including Facebook , Instagram and TikTok — provide potentially dangerous ingredients without specifying dosage amounts, giving the impression that abortions can be induced with herbs. One Instagram post detailed a list of homeopathic ingredients and then said, with a winking emoji, “I mean how else will we avoid accidental miscarriages? You’re smart enough to do this too.” “The myth of the safe, herbal abortion is pervasive,” Dr. Jen Gunter , an obstetrician/gynecologist who has written books on women’s health, explained in a Substack post addressing the issue. “It is a combination of two fallacies, appealing to the belief in the magical power of ancient remedies and that of course, natural is best.” But, she said, “ there are no safe, effective methods of inducing abortion with botanicals.” While some of the concoctions might result in an abortion, that may just be a byproduct of poisoning in the woman’s body, she explained, since “m any herbal abortifacients are quite literally poisons.” For example, one of the most commonly promoted plants is pennyroyal , a type of mint introduced to the U.S. from Europe. As with many persistent claims on the internet, there’s a grain of truth here. Pennyroyal has historically been associated with abortions, dating back to ancient Greece. But there’s insufficient evidence that pennyroyal can actually cause an abortion, according to the National Institutes of Health . Rather, the NIH’s National Library of Medicine says that it is likely unsafe to ingest pennyroyal oil because it can cause “serious liver and kidney damage, as well as nervous system damage.” Further, the NIH says, “There is some evidence that pennyroyal oil can cause abortions by causing the uterus to contract. But the dose needed in order to cause an abortion could kill the mother or cause life-long kidney and liver damage.” Another plant that’s been included in the lists on social media is parsley , which may sound innocuous but can be toxic if consumed in concentrated doses and is sometimes recommended to be inserted. A woman in Argentina reportedly died from septic shock and infection after trying to end a pregnancy using parsley in 2018. Generally, doctors and health experts recommend using tested, regulated medications for abortions. Medical abortions , which are done by taking medicine rather than having a physical procedure, accounted for about 28% of early abortions in 2016, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They are commonly performed by taking two drugs — mifepristone and misoprostol — which can be done at home. “People have been self-managing their abortions for decades with the support of community organizations and medical experts,” Dr. Nisha Verma , a fellow at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement provided by the organization to FactCheck.org. “We have seen that people can safely self-manage their abortions with medications like misoprostol. However, some people may also turn to unsafe abortion methods when they feel they have no other option or based on information they are gathering on social media,” she said. “It is important for people to understand that social media posts can be unreliable and can sometimes propagate misinformation. Misinformation can be harmful because it may lead people to try to end their pregnancies in an unsafe way, potentially exposing them to serious bodily harm. While people can self-manage their abortions in a safe way, spreading misinformation about unsafe methods of abortion is incredibly dangerous,” Verma said.

[/INST] The American Red Cross has made clear that people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to give blood if they are feeling healthy. The Food and Drug Administration guidelines for blood establishments say that people who were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized for use in the U.S. — Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson — do not need to wait any time between vaccination and donation, as long as they’re feeling healthy and have a normal temperature.  The FDA guidance says that only people who do not know what type of vaccine they received or got vaccinated with a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine would need to wait two weeks after vaccination to give blood. Currently, there are no live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines, which contain a live but weakened virus, authorized or approved for use by the FDA or the World Health Organization. The Red Cross also requires a two- to four-week wait for donors who received other live attenuated vaccines, such as the vaccine for measles or yellow fever, “out of an abundance of caution.” People who want to give blood should carry their vaccination card with the name of the vaccine manufacturer at the time of making a donation. “You may still donate blood, platelets or plasma after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine,” the Red Cross says on a website addressing blood donations and the coronavirus. Yet, posts on social media continue to mislead about the eligibility of vaccinated people to give blood, and about the way the Red Cross uses those donations. “sooooo Red Cross won’t use vaxxed blood ?? did I hear this correct??? I mean   this is normal right? nothing to see here?  and frankly I should know if I’m being given contaminated blood    no?,” reads one post published on Facebook on April 20. As we said, that is not correct. “[T]he American Red Cross accepts and uses donations from vaccinated people,” a spokesperson for the American Red Cross told us in an email. “Blood donations from individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are not ‘contaminated’ and are safe for blood transfusion. The COVID-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream.” The Red Cross told us the organization does not label blood donations based on vaccination status given that vaccination itself does not make blood unsafe. People who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can also donate blood 10 days after complete resolution of symptoms or 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19 if they did not develop symptoms, according to the FDA guidance . “Respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2, worldwide,” the FDA says in its guidance ."

Guevara’s words in The Motorcycle Diaries were highly critical of the blacks he came across in that Caracas neighborhood, and he placed them beneath Europeans. The experts we consulted said the remarks are real and would not have been unusual coming from a 24-year-old from Argentina at the time. Guevara’s quote about the Congo fighters lacking discipline could be interpreted as a criticism of their military readiness -- not a commentary on their race. We can’t fully evaluate the quote about blacks and the revolution without seeing it in full context. Experts said it was an exaggeration to suggest Guevara wrote \"extensively\" about racial superiority. Rubio’s comments gave the impression that Guevara wrote much more about the superiority of white Europeans over blacks than he did.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Taking Folic Acid, Not Other Folates, Is Recommended to Reduce Risk of Birth Defects\". [/INST] Neural tube defects affect the spinal cord and brain. They occur very early in pregnancy when the neural tube doesn’t close properly. The most common types are spina bifida , a defect of the spine that can range from having little impact to causing intellectual disability or paralysis, and anencephaly , a fatal defect in which parts of the brain and skull do not form. Taking a folic acid supplement prior to and during pregnancy — first broadly recommended in the U.S. in 1992 — can reduce the risk of these birth defects. The rate of neural tube defects fell in the U.S. after the government mandated in 1998 that certain grain products be fortified with folic acid. Folic acid is a form of folate , or vitamin B9. Folate helps the body with basic functions such as making DNA, which is necessary for cells to replicate. Widely shared social media posts incorrectly claim that people should not ingest folic acid, particularly those who have a certain common gene variant. “Folic acid is not a physiological active form of folate. It doesn’t do anything good,” one recent post stated , recommending that people take other folates. “If you have the mthfr gene mutation, avoid folic acid!” said another . People have made similar claims on multiple accounts over several years . There is a common variant of the MTHFR gene, particularly prevalent in Hispanic individuals, that slightly reduces the body’s ability to process folic acid. But people with this variant can still process folic acid and should take folic acid supplements at the usual dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. Prenatal supplements that contain a different type of folate, often a stabilized version of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, or 5-MTHF, are increasingly available . As with folic acid, taking 5-MTHF increases folate levels in the blood, so it could have a similar impact in theory. But folic acid “is the only type of folate shown to help prevent neural tube defects,” the CDC says . And when taken within the recommended amounts, folic acid doesn’t have any known health risks, a CDC spokesperson told us via email, contrary to claims in some social media posts. “Is having another form of folate adequate? We don’t know because the studies have not been done,” Dr. Shannon Clark , a professor of maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, told us. Such a study, comparing folic acid to another form of folate prior to conception and in early pregnancy, would likely never be approved due to ethical reasons, she said. “There are no clinical trials using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate as a substitute for folic acid to prevent birth defects,” said Patrick Stover , a metabolic biochemist and director of the Institute for Advancing Health through Agriculture at Texas A&M University. “That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t work, but it’s never been tested. … So likely it could be a substitute, but it’s never been tested, and it would be unethical to test it because there’s already a solution.” That solution, he explained, is consuming folic acid. A wide array of government and expert organizations recommend that people who could get pregnant consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — an independent group of experts on preventive medicine — recommends 400 to 800 mcg per day. The organizations vary on whether the recommended amount of folic acid, a synthetic folate, is limited to supplements or refers to fortified foods and supplements combined. Some guidelines specify that people should make sure to get 400 mcg folic acid on top of eating a generally healthy diet with naturally occurring folate. Expert groups representing physicians who treat pregnant people specify that folic acid supplementation should start at least a month prior to conception and continue through pregnancy week 12, since the neural tube is formed very early in pregnancy. There are separate folate recommendations for people who aren’t pregnant or soon-to-be pregnant. “For the general population there isn’t any recommendation from public health authorities about the folate versus folic acid versus [5-MTHF],” said Carol Haggans , a registered dietician and scientific and health communications consultant with the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. She noted that this group should focus on getting folate from food. The MTHFR gene tells the body how to make an enzyme that processes folate. The enzyme helps perform a step on the path to turning folic acid into 5-MTHF, a form of folate that is active in the body. As we said, some people have a variant of MTHFR that differs from the most common type. Expert organizations do not recommend routine testing for MTHFR variants . The most common MTHFR variant is MTHFR C677T, and approximately a quarter of people who are Hispanic, 10% of those who are white or Asian, and 1% of African Americans have two copies of this version of the gene. The variant is found at an even higher rate in some groups — reaching greater than 35% prevalence in people of Mexican or northern Chinese descent. People with two copies of this MTHFR variant have about 16% lower amounts of folate in their blood on average than people with two copies of the predominant version after consuming the same amount of folic acid. People with one copy of the variant also have reduced blood folate, but to a lesser degree. This is not enough of a reduction that people with the variant need to follow different instructions on supplementation. “Consuming 400 mcg of folic acid each day helps prevent neural tube defects, even if you have an MTHFR C677T variant. Taking a supplement with more than 400 mcg of folic acid each day is not necessarily better for preventing a neural tube defect,” the CDC says. People who have previously had a baby with a neural tube defect or who have certain health conditions may be recommended to take more folic acid. In recent years, the folates present in some prenatal supplements began to change, according to an analysis published in 2020 by researchers from the National Institutes of Health. Between September 2015 and March 2019, 32% of prescription and a quarter of nonprescription prenatal supplements included in NIH databases contained stabilized salts of 5-MTHF, said Haggans, who co-authored the report. Prior to September 2015, no supplements in the databases reported having salts of 5-MTHF. Our recent Google search for the “ best prenatal vitamins ” turned up best-of lists where the majority of listed supplements have other folates instead of folic acid. Like other vitamins and supplements, prenatal supplements are not approved for efficacy and safety by the Food and Drug Administration before companies can market them. Supplements do not have to contain particular vitamins and minerals to be marketed as prenatal, and their content varies . When asked via email if the increasing prevalence of 5-MTHF in prenatal vitamins is a public health concern, the CDC told us: “Yes. Currently there is only research to support the use of folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. No scientific studies exist that show that supplements containing other types of folate (such as 5-MTHF) can help prevent neural tube defects. Therefore, we do not know if prenatal vitamins with 5-MTHF offer the same level of protection against neural tube defects as those with folic acid.” Studies do show that taking 5-MTHF increases the concentration of folate in the blood. However, CDC scientists wrote in a review paper that to establish efficacy of 5-MTHF in preventing neural tube defects, there would need to be a randomized trial demonstrating that it was safe and effective and establishing the proper dose and timing. Stover pointed out that 5-MTHF has two downsides. The first is that it is much more expensive to make than folic acid. The second is that 5-MTHF is less stable. This leads to concern that the level of intact folate found in some supplements at the time they’re consumed could differ from the amount listed on the label. Newer forms of 5-MTHF have improved stability, he said, but “it does not achieve the stability of folic acid.” Someone could theoretically aim to get the equivalent of 400 mcg folic acid only from eating a healthy diet rich in natural food folate. However, getting this amount of folate from unfortified foods alone “requires consumption of a large quantity of foods not typically consumed,” the CDC scientists wrote in the review. “For example, a person would need to consume approximately 12 cups of raw spinach daily to reach the recommended level.” Further, the researchers wrote, studies haven’t determined how much natural food folate is needed to reduce neural tube defects or how it interacts with other vitamins, “so it is not possible to recommend an intake of natural food folate that is certain to prevent [neural tube defects].” Social media posts bring up that folic acid “ doesn’t exist in nature ” or “ doesn’t occur anywhere naturally .” Indeed, it is a synthetic folate used in supplements and for food fortification due to its relative stability in the presence of heat and light compared with folate naturally found in food. (Folic acid only occurs in nature in trace amounts, Stover explained.) But 5-MTHF supplements are also not the same as natural food folate. The folate found naturally in food is less bioavailable — meaning it’s less easily absorbed and used by the body — than either folic acid or 5-MTHF supplements. “Just because something isn’t found naturally in food in high concentrations doesn’t mean it’s harmful,” Stover said. The FDA does require supplements to have a “supplement facts” label including a list of dietary ingredients and the amount per serving. Supplement labels can cause confusion, Haggans said, because folate is measured in various ways. The FDA requires that labels have in parentheses the mcg of folic acid to aid people who are trying to prevent neural tube defects. “The number to look for is the number in parentheses,” Haggans said. And again, experts generally recommend 400 mcg of folic acid for people who could become pregnant. The parenthetical value should specify that it is talking about folic acid — some supplement makers include a number in parentheses referring to the mcg of other folates. These are usually versions of 5-MTHF, which is sometimes also referred to as L-5-MTHF or methylfolate. “If the supplement label does not specifically say folic acid in the parentheses then it does not have folic acid,” Clark said. Folic acid is safe when taken as recommended. “Folic acid taken at or up to the recommended amount of 400-800 micrograms per day (mcg/day) has not been shown to be harmful,” the CDC spokesperson told us. The tolerable upper intake level for folate from fortified food or supplements in adults, including pregnant people, is 1,000 mcg daily , according to the Institute of Medicine, which provides these numbers to indicate the level under which a nutrient is unlikely to pose any health risks to “almost all individuals in the general population.” One-third of U.S. pregnant women are estimated to consume amounts of folic acid from fortified foods and supplements that put them over the tolerable upper intake level, according to a 2019 study published in JAMA Network Open. The limit was established because of concern that folate at high levels — over 5,000 mcg daily — could cause a B12 vitamin deficiency to go undiagnosed, leading to potential neurologic complications. The theory was that consuming high levels of folic acid could improve a type of anemia resulting from low B12 without correcting other problems associated with the deficiency. People of reproductive age have a low rate of B12 deficiency, especially compared with older adults. However, the CDC spokesperson noted that people who have low B12 are unlikely to get as much benefit from 5-MTHF as from folic acid because “5-MTHF needs vitamin B-12 to work in the body, while folic acid can work without this vitamin.” Some supplement companies argue that 5-MTHF is safer because when folic acid is not fully metabolized, it can circulate in the blood. But harms from circulating folic acid have not been established, Stover said. “That’s not an adverse effect. It just shows you’ve saturated the system,” he said. “It’s circulating. It’s not known to have any activity or function when it’s circulating.” Excess folic acid is eventually excreted in urine. A separate possibility is that elevated folate status in general could have some negative impact, Stover said, meaning there could be some consequence to having large amounts of folate in the body no matter the type. Someone could have elevated folate status regardless of what form they consumed, he added. But, observations that indicate elevated folate levels in the body or excess folic acid intake can have negative health impacts — mainly from animal and nonrandomized studies — are inconclusive, Stover and his colleagues wrote in a summary paper. Still, “you should never take more than is recommended is the bottom line,” Stover said. “More isn’t always better, but you don’t want to be deficient.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Far More Lethal Than a Cold, Contrary to Suggestion in Viral Video\". [/INST] COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Heart disease and cancer were in the first and second spots. An analysis of CDC data from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Peterson Center on Health shows that the same ranking is expected for 2021. COVID-19 deaths dropped to seventh place in July after vaccines had become widely available. But t he more contagious delta variant of the virus that causes the disease — paired with low vaccination rates in some areas and relaxed attitudes toward mitigation measures such as social distancing and mask wearing — led to an increase in deaths later in the summer. The total death toll from COVID-19 in the U.S. was more than 805,000 as of Dec. 22, according to the CDC. Despite those facts, a TikTok video suggesting that the disease is the same as a common cold has racked up more than 4 million views. Similarly, a post on Facebook implying that the now dominant omicron variant is actually just the common cold has been shared more than 1,000 times. The video, which was posted by an account that has advocated against public health measures like mask wearing and vaccination , opens with a woman saying, “Y’all want to see something cool? Let’s take a peek at something coming straight from the source.” It then shows a 1989 edition of the American Medical Association’s Encyclopedia of Medicine, which describes itself as a resource book for “the general American public.” Next, the video shows a page in the book that illustrates 12 families of viruses, including coronaviruses. The woman’s finger then moves down a corresponding list of “examples of conditions or diseases” caused by each family of virus. “Common cold” is listed for the coronavirus family. Although that’s the only evidence the video includes, TikTok users have used it to spread anti-vaccine messages, using hashtags like “ #covid19 #commoncold #novaccineforme ” and “ #novaccine #covid19 #governmentcontrol .” But the video’s suggestion that COVID-19 equates to a cold is based on the misconception that there is only one type of coronavirus. As we have explained before , coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from the Latin word for crown because they are characterized by spike proteins that look like crowns. There are hundreds of coronaviruses — most of which circulate among animals. There are seven coronaviruses known to infect humans, according to the CDC . Four of them cause upper-respiratory tract illnesses , often referred to as a cold. Three of them cause more serious illnesses, including s evere acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) and COVID-19. All three of the viruses that cause more serious disease developed in humans after the publication of the AMA’s Encyclopedia of Medicine in 1989. SARS was first reported in 2003, MERS was first reported in 2012, and COVID-19 was first reported in 2019. So, the video is using a book that predates COVID-19 by 30 years. It also promotes the misconception that the word “coronavirus” refers to only one single virus, which we addressed at the beginning of the pandemic . Common colds, it should be mentioned, can be caused by a variety of viruses. Rhinoviruses, not coronaviruses, are actually the most common, according to the CDC . The claim that COVID-19 is similar to a cold has previously circulated on social media, too. Reuters addressed it in September 2020. The fact is, while some cases of COVID-19 can be mild, the potential for a severe outcome is much higher than for the common cold — especially for older people. For example, the CDC estimates that the risk of death is 370 times higher for someone 85 years and older as compared with someone between the ages of 18 and 29. “ The common cold is generally not lethal, with some rare exceptions,” according to experts at the Meedan Health Desk . Colds typically get better in a few days or weeks, according to the American Lung Association , but they can sometimes lead to other infections, including bronchitis. “Compared to the common cold, COVID-19 kills more people in every age group, and is especially more lethal in the oldest age groups,” the experts at Meedan said.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Use Fabricated Audio to Misrepresent CNN Report During Rocket Attack in Israel\". [/INST] The Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, launching rockets from Gaza and infiltrating the Israeli border by air, ground and sea to target civilians and soldiers and take hostages. Israel responded by declaring war on Hamas, mobilizing its military reservists and starting airstrikes on Gaza. More than 5,000 Palestinians and 1,400 Israelis have been killed in the war, as of Oct. 23, the United Nations said , citing the Gaza Ministry of Health and Israeli official sources, respectively. Meanwhile, the conflict has been a source for widespread misinformation online. Journalists in the region have been at risk due to their proximity to ground assaults and fired missiles. At least 23 journalists covering the conflict have been confirmed dead , with 11 others injured, missing or detained, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists , a nonprofit that “defend[s] the right of journalists to report the news safely and without fear of reprisal.” One news crew caught up near ongoing attacks was a CNN team led by chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward on Oct. 9 . While Ward’s team was preparing to cover the route that Hamas militants took during its Oct. 7 attack, Israel’s Iron Dome defense system intercepted rockets overhead, forcing the team to shelter in a roadside ditch. In the days following Ward’s coverage, social media posts shared an altered version of the news coverage, which added audio of a fake phone call between a CNN producer and Ward’s team, directing them to “look nice and scared” and purportedly adding explosion sound effects — giving the impression that the news coverage was faked. An Oct. 16 Instagram post read, “CNN Get Caught Faking an Attack From Hamas in Israel,” on screen, as well as a caption claiming, “in order to EXAGGERATE the narrative CNN is FAKING CONTENT!” Another Instagram post , which has received over 2,700 likes, has the words “Leaked Footage … Directors Edition” added on screen, with a caption that claims, “CNN is done after this. Bye bye fake news.” But the audio was added to the news report “satirically” by The Quartering, a conservative commentary organization. While the organization clarified that one of its editors added the voiceover as a parody, the social media posts lack this context — leading many social media users to believe the audio is real. A CNN spokesperson told us in an email, “The audio in the video posted and shared on X is fabricated, inaccurate and irresponsibly distorts the reality of the moment that was covered live on CNN, which people should watch in full for themselves on a trusted platform.” We should note that while The Quartering acknowledged that the audio was not real, the organization continues to claim the CNN team was “acting” to exaggerate the danger of the situation. “Yes of course the voice over isn’t real but the fake acting IS real,” posted The Quartering on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Oct. 10. In a video posted to YouTube on Oct. 13, the organization’s host continued , “the intent of that video was never to convince people that [the audio] was real. It was to point out those actors, those CNN news actors, were very clearly acting.” False claims that news reports are being fabricated are popular during ongoing wars, as we’ve written before ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Distort Greta Thunberg Tweet Warning About Climate Change\". [/INST] James G. Anderson , a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University, delivered a lecture in 2018 at the University of Chicago about the effects of climate change on the planet. Among the dangers Anderson highlighted was the depletion of floating ice in the Arctic . Anderson warned that an urgent effort is needed to stop producing carbon pollution and remove it from the atmosphere within five years to preserve any permanent ice in the Arctic, Forbes reported. The following month, the now-defunct news website Grit Post cited the Forbes piece in an article that misinterpreted Anderson’s lecture and had the inaccurate headline, “Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don’t Fix Climate Change by 2023.” Greta Thunberg , a young climate activist from Sweden who rose to prominence when she organized the 2018 School Strike for Climate movement , quoted from the Grit Post article in a since-deleted June 2018 tweet . Thunberg’s tweet said: “A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.” With the fifth anniversary of her tweet recently passed, social media posts have falsely claimed that Thunberg predicted human extinction would occur by 2023. “Greta Thunberg’s apocalyptic tweet proves false exactly 5 years later to the day,” read a Facebook post from the Young America’s Foundation. Donald J. Trump, Jr. shared a post to Instagram which read: “Greta Thunberg’s beginning of the end of the world prediction was for today, June 21st.” His post received more than 99,000 likes. But Thunberg’s 2018 tweet did not say that humanity would be wiped out in five years, but rather that continued use of fossil fuels over the next five years would lead to human extinction at some point. The tweet was, moreover, quoting from an article and not her own words. Thunberg has been the subject of viral false claims before, as we’ve written . These claims often target her credibility as a climate activist, such as the false claim that she is on the payroll of billionaire George Soros. In this case, though, Thunberg has been both the subject and spreader of misinformation. According to Anderson — the “top climate specialist” in question — the quote from Grit Post that Thunberg shared was a “complete fabrication” of his words. “The ‘.. wiping out of humanity by 2022’ is a total distortion of what I said, implied, or meant at the University of Chicago colloquium in 2018,” Anderson told us in an email on June 23. “I would never make such a statement.” Rather, Anderson’s statement was that at the rate of floating ice loss in 2018, there would be no more floating ice within five years. In his email to us, Anderson said, “the only reason there is any floating ice on the Arctic Ocean remaining today is that the last 15 to 20% of that floating ice volume is protected by the existence of the Greenland glacial mass.” “Ironically, of course, for the past 10,000 years it was the Arctic Ice Cap on the Arctic Ocean that protected Greenland through the summer melt season,” Anderson said. “Now there is virtually no protection of the Greenland glacial system via the floating ice on the Arctic Ocean. This is a profound concern for the increasing rate of sea level rise. Another key point of context is that the volume of floating ice on the Arctic Ocean was essentially stable over the past 10,000 years, yet in just the past 40 years approximately 80% of that floating ice volume has been lost.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Distorts Early Coronavirus Research To Promote Baseless Bioweapon Conspiracy Theory\". [/INST] Scientists have been studying coronaviruses, a family of viruses that infect animals and humans, for decades — the first was identified in chickens in the 1930s. In 1968, after the first human coronavirus was identified in 1965, virologists grouped them and named them coronaviruses for their crown-like surface, which also resembles the outermost layer of the sun called the corona (corona is the Latin word for crown). Seven coronaviruses are known to infect humans — four of them, known as common human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1), generally cause mild to moderate symptoms of a common cold. But coronaviruses got more attention in 2003, after the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 , the first coronavirus known to cause a severe respiratory illness in humans, followed by ME R S-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, in 2019. Both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV originated in animals and jumped to humans. Although there is still no proof of how SARS-CoV-2 started, many scientists think the available evidence also points to a zoonotic spillover. If SARS-CoV-2 did escape from a lab in Wuhan, there is a general consensus that it was an accident. A U.S. Intelligence report released in 2021 showed that all agencies agreed that “the virus was not developed as a biological weapon” and “most” said the virus “probably was not genetically engineered,” as we reported . Yet, in a widely shared video misleadingly presented as testimony to the European Parliament, David Martin, a financial analyst , cited unrelated patents and distorted early research on coronaviruses to falsely suggest that scientists in the U.S. created the viruses that cause SARS and COVID-19 as part of a plot to drive vaccine profits. “Ladies and gentlemen, this was premeditated domestic terrorism,” he said of the COVID-19 pandemic (mark 19:22). “This is an act of biological and chemical warfare perpetrated on the human race. … [T]his was a financial heist and a financial fraud,” he added — a quote that was later shared in a Twitter post that has been retweeted more than 75,000 times. Except Martin’s entire argument is bunk. Dr. Susan R. Weiss , a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in a phone interview that his statements are full of inaccuracies and completely distort past coronavirus research. “There is no basis for any of this,” she said. “It makes no scientific sense.” Martin has pushed several conspiracy theories about the pandemic. In 2020, he was a central figure in the second “Plandemic” video, which also falsely claimed that the pandemic was planned, as we’ve written . Part of the appeal of Martin’s video — and lending false legitimacy to his claims — is that at first glance, it appears he is speaking in front of the European Parliament and giving official testimony. “[C]ant believe my ears, what is being said at the europian union,” a Facebook user said , sharing the video, which shows Martin next to a European Parliament flag in what might look to someone like the European Parliament Hemicycle. “Must watch: This is the opening presentation by Dr David Martin on the origins of Covid in 1965 & Covid Vaccines in 1990!” a Twitter user wrote . “He speaks in front of the European Parliament International Covid Summit III in Brussels on May 3, 2023. Hear and be shocked..!” In reality, only five of the 705 members of the European Parliament participated in the event, which took place in a room of the parliament’s building in Brussels, as part of a three-day meeting organized by COVID-19 skeptics and anti-vaccination activists. The five Parliament members have participated in actions opposing COVID-19 vaccines. Natalie Kontoulis, a press officer for the European Parliament, told us in an email that the meeting “was not an official European Parliament event.” She added, “Members of the Parliament can exercise their mandate freely and bear responsibility for both their activities and their content.” According to the event’s website , the speaker line-up included some prominent COVID-19 misinformation spreaders, including Dr. Robert Malone , Dr. Pierre Kory , and Dr. Ryan Cole . The event content was turned into a book called “ICS 3 – The Whole Truth” and commercialized — a paperback copy sells for $29.99. During the almost 22-minute video, Martin spins a scientifically impossible story that suggests that SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses are the result of experimentation with common cold coronaviruses that were discovered in the 1960s. “This is actually something that’s been long in the making,” he said of the COVID-19 pandemic (mark 5:31). “In 1967, the year I was born, we did the first human trials on inoculating people with modified coronavirus. Isn’t that amazing? 56 years ago — the overnight success of a pathogen that’s been 56 years in engineering.” But Martin, who misleads throughout by implying all coronaviruses might be the same, is misrepresenting a study that involved infecting people with a coronavirus that causes a cold. The virus had not been modified. More important, the notion that a common coronavirus could have been manipulated or engineered to create SARS-CoV-2 is incorrect. “They’re too different,” Weiss said. “We don’t have the ability to turn one into the other.” About a minute later, he said, “Ironically, the common cold was turned into a chimera in the 1970s. And in 1975, 1976, and 1977 we started figuring out how to modify coronavirus by putting it into different animals, pigs and dogs.” “That doesn’t make any sense,” Weiss told us. First, as we said, there are multiple kinds of coronaviruses. Some infect animals and others infect humans — and a few can cross from one species to another one, Weiss told us. “It turns out, the human virus … at least the cold virus, as far as I know, only replicates in humans.” The viruses couldn’t be genetically modified at that time, either, she explained. “We couldn’t engineer viruses at that time,” she said of the 1970s, since the technology to do it, such as cloning, didn’t yet exist. Martin continues to mislead by saying the inoculation of those supposedly modified common coronaviruses created a huge problem in the pig and dog industry, which led Pfizer to patent its “first spike protein vaccine” in 1990. “Isn’t that fascinating? Isn’t it fascinating that we were, we were told that, ‘Well, the spike protein is a new thing,’” he said (mark 7:44). Except, that patent was for a canine coronavirus vaccine, which targets an entirely different virus from SARS-CoV-2. In 2020, we debunked related claims that also confused canine coronavirus with the virus that caused the pandemic. Moreover, scientists have never said that coronavirus spike proteins are “new.” The specific SARS-CoV-2 spike was new, and the genetic sequence was needed to design the vaccines. But one reason why the COVID-19 vaccines could be made so rapidly is because scientists already knew the virus’s spike proteins would be good vaccine targets. The existence of that previous knowledge is not evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created as a bioweapon or as part of a ploy to sell vaccines. Martin also falsely claims that SARS-CoV-1 was created in an American lab. “Are you suggesting that SARS … might have come from a laboratory in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill? No, I’m not suggesting it. I’m telling you that’s the facts — we engineered SARS,” he said. “SARS is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. The naturally occurring phenomenon is called the common cold … SARS is the research developed by humans weaponizing a life system model to actually attack human beings.” There is no evidence SARS-CoV-1 was engineered or came from any lab. The virus naturally appeared in 2002 in China, when it likely jumped from civets to humans, and its origins are linked to bats. Martin pointed to a 2002 patent as supposed proof. But the patent, which is for a method for creating viral vectors, focuses on a pig coronavirus (viral vectors are used to deliver genetic information to cells). As before, the patent is not evidence that the SARS virus was engineered. Martin also distorted the meaning of a line of the patent that says the method could help produce “an infectious, replication defective, coronavirus particle.” “Listen to those words: infectious replication defective,” Martin said suggestively (mark 10:18). “What does that phrase actually mean for those of you not familiar with language? Let me unpack it for you. Infectious replication defective means a weapon. It means something meant to target an individual but not have collateral damage to other individuals.” But he’s wrong again. Replication-defective simply means that a viral particle would be incapable of replicating itself."

[/INST] The Food and Drug Administration has authorized more than 200 different PCR tests since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Those tests have been among the most accurate for diagnosing the disease, although results can take longer to get than for rapid antigen tests since they are typically processed in a lab. Both the Cleveland Clinic and the then-director of the National Institutes of Health have called PCR tests the “gold standard” in detecting the virus that causes COVID-19. The tests work by searching for stretches of genetic material in a person’s sample, typically a nasal swab or some saliva, that match those found in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. If the coronavirus is present, then a short snippet of genetic material is copied many times over, which can be read out on a machine. If the coronavirus isn’t there — or if there’s a different virus, such as influenza — then there’s no match, copies aren’t made, and there’s no signal to detect. Because those stretches are carefully selected to be sequences that are unique to the coronavirus, the tests are very specific — and almost never turn up positive because someone is infected with a different pathogen. Despite the years of use and studies showing the effectiveness of PCR tests, online posts misleadingly claim to list more than 50 germs that could produce a false positive result on a PCR test. The claim feeds into the longstanding partisan suggestion that the impact of COVID-19 — which has killed more than 870,000 people in the U.S. as of Jan. 27 — has been inflated. The list appears to have originated on Telegram, a social media platform that has attracted a right-wing audience fleeing larger platforms that correct misinformation. On Nov. 23, David Rodriguez, a former boxer who promotes far-right politics and embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory , posted the list on his Telegram channel with this message: “Did you know there are a total of 57 potential cross reactants that could give you a false positive when administering the PCR tests? It’s also note worthy, that Sars-Covi-2 has STILL not been isolated.” The list that follows catalogs a variety of pathogens — some misspelled — including common viruses, such as different types of influenza, along with various species of bacteria and fungi. The next day, an Australian QAnon account posted the claim to Gab , another social media platform with a right-wing following. And other partisan accounts continued to share it. Recently, the claim has bubbled up on Facebook, where it was posted by two chiropractors who have used their platforms to spread misinformation about the pandemic. Anita Mihlon , a chiropractor in New Jersey who has posted anti-vaccination content for years, and Eric Nepute , a chiropractor in Missouri whom we’ve written about before, each posted the list with their own messages attached."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Twists Advice on Delta Variant and Vaccination\". [/INST] Studies indicate that currently available vaccines are largely effective against the delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19. But a video circulating on Facebook wrongly tells viewers the opposite. The video is part of a series of similar webcasts from Jen DePice, a Philadelphia-area chiropractor who has used Facebook to advocate against the vaccines. Another video in the series, for example, is pinned to the top of her organization’s page with this message: “JUST SAY NO…to the Jab! 🗽 ❌ 💉 “ The video we’ll address here has been viewed 48,000 times and has garnered comments such as, “Best news as I’ve not been VAC & have no plans to be.” In the video, DePice claims that those who are exposed to the delta variant are “twice as likely to require hospitalization if the person was vaccinated.” There is no support for this statement, and, as we noted, studies have shown the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. are largely effective against the delta variant. Although DePice says that her claim is based on research “from Harvard,” we could find no such study, and she didn’t respond to a message on her Facebook account asking for further details. However, it appears that she misrepresented an interview with a Harvard University professor. The post accompanying the video links to an interview Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health posted with William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology. In that July 8 interview, Hanage said (emphasis added), “Delta’s greater virulence means that unvaccinated people who become infected will be sicker and the burden on the health care system will be greater. Evidence suggests, for example, that an unvaccinated person with Delta infection is roughly twice as likely to require hospital treatment than a person infected with the previously dominant variant.” Hanage’s point is supported by a Scottish study published in June that found the risk of hospitalization was about twice as high for those with the delta variant compared with those with the previously dominant alpha variant, but the finding was preliminary. As we’ve explained , it’s not yet settled whether the delta variant causes more severe disease than other versions of the virus. Public Health England, for example, posted an assessment on July 23 saying that the delta variant appeared to increase the risk of hospitalization relative to alpha, but that there was a “low” level of confidence about this. But, as far as DePice’s claim is concerned, it appears that she has misrepresented what Hanage said about what group is at higher risk to be hospitalized. She also failed to convey what Hanage said about the value of vaccination against COVID-19 generally. Hanage clearly advised in that interview: “Get vaccinated if you are not already.” He explained that the high transmissibility of the delta variant means that the virus can spread faster than the rate of vaccination around the world. This variant also appears to produce high viral loads early in infection, he said, “which may mean that it’s even more infectious during the period when people don’t yet realize they’re infected.” A July study from China that has yet to be peer reviewed found that the viral load for those infected with the delta variant was 1,000 times higher than for those who had the original strain of the virus. Hanage also noted in the interview that the delta variant appears to be more able to cause “so-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people.” But, he said, the resulting infections are “comparatively mild.” In the U.S., the delta variant accounted for 83% of COVID-19 cases for the two weeks ending July 17, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated. And on July 16, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said at a press briefing that more than 97% of those who were hospitalized were unvaccinated. As we said, the vaccines appear to be effective against the delta variant, but several studies have emphasized the importance of getting the full dosage of the vaccine if two shots are required, as is the case for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Flawed Paper on COVID-19 Vaccines, Deaths Spreads Widely Before Retraction\". [/INST] Unverified reports of adverse events that occur following receipt of a vaccine have been a key source of misinformation for months. As we’ve repeatedly documented , anyone can submit a report to the U.S. system and the reports alone are not proof of a link to a vaccine. In the latest iteration of that type of data being misrepresented, a peer-reviewed paper published in a scientific journal used it to dubiously claim that the COVID-19 vaccines were causing deaths at such a scale that they nearly rival the number of lives saved through the vaccines. “For three deaths prevented by vaccination we have to accept two inflicted by vaccination,” the paper, published on June 24 in Vaccines , claimed.  Days after the analysis was published — amid backlash from scientists , some of whom resigned from editorial roles with the publication — the journal issued a June 28 statement noting that there were “significant concerns” with the paper and that its assertion that the deaths were linked to vaccination “is incorrect and distorted.” “The data has been misused because it makes the (incorrect) assumption that all deaths occurring post vaccination are caused by vaccination,” Katie Ewer , an immunologist at the University of Oxford, told Science in an email. “[And] it is now being used by anti-vaxxers and COVID-19-deniers as evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. [This] is grossly irresponsible, particularly for a journal specialising in vaccines.” Vaccines , based in Switzerland , formally retracted the paper on July 2. But in the days between its publication and retraction, the paper and its claims found a significant audience on social media, where they were spread widely across platforms . The link to the paper was shared nearly 9,000 times on Facebook as of early July 2, according to CrowdTangle analytics data . Metrics on the journal’s site indicate it was viewed more than 367,000 times. Liz Wheeler, a conservative commentator, promoted the paper in a June 30 video on Facebook — viewed more than 250,000 times — titled, “ The Vaccine Study You’re Not Allowed To See.” “This is a peer-reviewed, scientific study,” Wheeler tells her viewers. “Essentially, this peer-reviewed scientific study shows that COVID-19 vaccine causes two deaths for every three lives it saves.” Behind her in parts of the video is a board repeating the study’s claim as a statement of fact: “ COVID vax kills two people for every three saved.” As we said, the journal had acknowledged two days earlier that the data about purported deaths from the vaccines had been “distorted.” The paper said that the authors used “the data of the Dutch national register … to gauge the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations.” But the Dutch reporting system — maintained by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre, called Lareb — includes a prominent disclaimer explicitly stating that a reported side effect may not be from the vaccine, similar to the adverse event reporting system used in the U.S., which we’ve explained . Dr. Eugène van Puijenbroek , h ead of science and research at Lareb, told us in an email that the data used in the analysis “were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions.” He said he had requested that the journal “make either an appropriate correction” or retract the study. The system is used to “ highlight possible safety signals at an early stage,” he said. “A reported event that occurred after vaccination is therefore not necessarily being caused by the vaccination, although our data was presented as being causally related by the authors. It should be noted that also the database of the European Medicines Agency that is mentioned in this article contains the same type of reports.” “As clearly stated on our website, but not taken [into] account in the method applied in this article, death after vaccination does not imply that the adverse event is indeed the actual cause of death,” he said. “Existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases. In a limited number of reports, adverse events following immunisation, known to be associated with the COVID vaccines (e.g. fever, nausea or malaise), may have contributed to the worsening of an already fragile health condition or an underlying medical condition. Suggesting all reports with a fatal outcome to be causally related is far from truth.” Also, Van Puijenbroek said, the paper’s assertion that the reported deaths “ were certified by medical specialists” is “simply incorrect.” The lead author of the study, Harald Walach, is a psychologist and professor at Poznan University of the Medical Sciences in Poland. He and his co-authors penned a two-page letter defending their study, published by Retraction Watch, in which they admitted “that these data are far from perfect” but said they were justified in using the data for analysis because “they are the only ones that are available.” They also claimed that “[c]urrently we only have association, we agree, and we never said anything else.” There were other issues with the paper, too. In addition to the fact that the deaths and other adverse events reported to the Dutch system are not confirmed to be caused by the vaccines, the authors arbitrarily chose to use that system to look at the case reports submitted per 100,000 vaccinations. But that system’s volume is an outlier, relative to the rest of Europe. “They have a median of 127 per 100k, ranging from 15 to 701, with Netherlands’ 701 being an extreme outlier,” Jeffrey Morris , director of the division of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, told us in an email. “They give some unconvincing rationale why they think using the 701 to represent the truth is the best idea, thus strongly skewing the adverse event rate of vaccines by a factor of almost 6 relative to using the median for all of Europe.” The paper also uses a concept known as the number needed to vaccinate, or NNTV, to estimate how many doses would need to be administered in order to avert one COVID-19 case or death. For deaths, it concludes that “the NNTV to prevent one death is between 9000 and 50,000 (95% confidence interval), with 16,000 as a point estimate.” But using that kind of measure — also referred to as the number needed to treat, or NNT — is problematic for several reasons, Morris said, especially for something where the risk is spread over a long period of time. “The key factor here is that NNT depends directly on the time frame, and when you compute it using data from a short term study, it severely [underestimates] the benefit when the risk is spread over a longer time frame,” he said. The authors used data from an Israeli study that followed up with participants who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for an average of 15 days. Morris said the short time frame for computing vaccine benefit is “especially misleading” since the reported adverse events (which again, aren’t confirmed to be due to the vaccine) are typically occurring within that short time frame — “but only a small fraction of the beneficial effects of the vaccine, preventing cases for the next year or two or longer, are captured.” Also, the measure is influenced by other factors — such as lockdowns, social distancing and masking. And when many people are vaccinated, the probability of infection and death goes down — therefore making the number needed to vaccinate higher (and the vaccine benefit appear smaller). “In short, the NNT is an extremely flawed measure even if they had good data for estimating the risk of infection, hospitalization and death for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and interpreted the data properly (which of course they did not),” Morris said."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Mislead About Harris’ Romance with Willie Brown\". [/INST] False and misleading claims targeting Vice President Kamala Harris intensified as she drew closer to formally becoming the Democratic nominee for president on Aug. 5. We’ve written about the false narrative that Harris only recently began identifying as Black. Another viral claim circulating on social media rehashes old rumors about Harris’ relationship with the influential California Democrat Willie Brown in the 1990s while Harris was working as an assistant district attorney . These posts misleadingly claimed that Harris “ started her career ” by sleeping with a married man or that she “ stole a black womans husband .” Here is what we know about Harris’ relationship with Brown. Harris was 29 in March 1994 when a San Francisco Chronicle columnist described her as Brown’s “new steady,” going on to say that she was “something new in Willie’s love life. She’s a woman, not a girl.” At the time, Brown, who was then 60 years old and speaker of the California State Assembly, had been estranged from his wife for more than a decade. As speaker, Brown appointed Harris to the California Medical Assistance Commission later that year, which provides the basis for claims that Brown helped Harris’ career that sometimes accompany the claims suggesting that she broke up his marriage. (Brown left the Assembly in 1995, and became mayor of San Francisco until 2004.) Brown had married Blanche Vitero in 1957 and the couple had three children. But by the early 1970s, Brown was frequently seen around town with young women and his marriage collapsed, according to a 1996 biography written by James Richardson , a senior writer at the Sacramento Bee. It was at this time that Brown got the first of a “series of apartments” of his own, while his “relationship with his wife settled into a mutually beneficial friendship,” Richardson wrote. A 1984 profile published in the New York Times described Brown as an “escort for attractive women” and “good friend of his former wife,” from whom it says he “separated amicably” two years earlier. “I don’t know whether the marriage failed and the relationship survived or vice versa, but something very valuable lasted,” Brown wrote in his own 2008 autobiography , explaining that he and his wife had celebrated their 50th anniversary in 2007, although they hadn’t lived together in 25 years. “Although Blanche and I led very different lives, there was never a breakup,” he wrote. “The two of us kept the family circle going. We’ve always been in each other’s lives. We’re friends.” Indeed, as we said, Brown had developed a reputation for dating around and, in 2001, he welcomed a fourth child, a daughter , with his then-girlfriend Carolyn Carpeneti. Harris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship by the end of 1995 or the beginning of 1996 . But it has come up repeatedly since Harris first sought public office as San Francisco district attorney, which she won in 2003. During that campaign, Harris was trying to distance herself from Brown, telling SF Weekly , “His career is over; I will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years. I do not owe him a thing.” She called him an “albatross hanging around my neck.” But, 20 years later, claims about that relationship continue to shadow Harris as she seeks higher office. Clarification, Aug. 8: We updated this story to better reflect the time frame for when Harris and Brown reportedly ended their relationship."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Baseless Claims Proliferate on Hurricanes and Weather Modification\". [/INST] Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26, followed by Hurricane Milton on Oct. 9. Amid the deaths and destruction from the hurricanes, social media posts spread bogus claims that someone had caused or altered the storms via some weather modification technique. There is a real history of weather modification efforts, with some modest results in producing snow and rain through a technique called cloud seeding. However, it has never been shown to be possible to meaningfully modify hurricanes, nor is there any basis for the idea that someone manipulated Hurricanes Helene or Milton. “Hurricane Helene was NOT a ‘naturally occurring’ weather event,” said some of the many baseless posts on the topic. “This event was entirely MANIPULATED by man, & guided into a certain direction, for a certain reason.” While many posts were vague about who had purportedly controlled the hurricanes, others pointed a finger at the U.S. government. “A hurricane as weather warfare,” read one post . “If you want to argue with me I’m happy to bury you in patents, gov contracts and tax dollars. You are looking at one of the most horrific events ever perpetrated by our government on its own people.” Claims about Helene then morphed into claims about Milton. “Hurricane Milton is targeted geo-engineered storm being used as a weapon,” wrote Stew Peters , an internet personality who has spread numerous conspiracy theories, in an X post . Among those adding fuel to these claims was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , who unleashed a series of X posts implying purposeful modification of the storms. “Yes they can control the weather,” Greene posted on Oct. 3. “It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.” Greene, who is a Republican from Georgia, which has been affected by the storms, didn’t explain who “they” are or why someone would want to cause a devastating hurricane. But earlier that day she had posted a map that has been connected to a claim that Hurricane Helene was targeted to disproportionately affect Republicans. In the days since, as another hurricane headed toward Florida, Greene continued to post about weather modification , doubling down on her suggestion. She has a history of spreading conspiracy theories and other misinformation, including about natural disasters . Not only is there zero evidence that anyone attempted to alter the paths of the hurricanes, but it is implausible that someone could modify a hurricane, let alone in such a way to target specific groups. “There is no scientific proof that any weather modification has been successful in hurricanes,” Katja Friedrich , who studies cloud and precipitation formation and modification at the University of Colorado Boulder, told us in an email. President Joe Biden referenced Greene’s claims in an Oct. 9 press conference, saying the idea that “we’re controlling the weather” is “beyond ridiculous.” He continued, “It’s got to stop. In moments like this, there are no red or blue states.” Greene also made fun of people who have implicated climate change in the hurricanes, ridiculing the idea that “cow farts” could cause them. Other social media posts also dismissed climate change as a possible contributor to the hurricanes, claiming , for instance, that “[w]eather modification crimes [are] hiding behind the label of Climate Change.” But there is a good case that climate change made various aspects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton worse, and it’s clear that climate change will influence hurricane activity over the coming years. (Also for the record, methane emissions from livestock do contribute to climate change, but the majority of the methane produced by cows is emitted via burps, not farts.) “Climate change didn’t cause these storms to occur but it plausibly altered the odds of them reaching certain thresholds of intensity, rapid intensification, or rainfall rates, for example,” Tom Knutson , a senior scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told us in an email. People have a long history of trying to change the weather — not all of it well-intentioned — but the successes are limited. Many posts , including some by Greene , mentioned or linked to sources referencing cloud seeding, the primary method used for weather modification. In some U.S. states and countries, governments, utilities and companies pay for cloud seeding to enhance the snowpack in the mountains or to increase rainfall in dry regions. The technique relies on adding small particles to clouds to stimulate ice crystals or droplets to form, which can fall to the ground as rain or snow. In the U.S., ground-based machines or airplanes generally release silver iodide, nudging nearby clouds to release snow. There have been questions about how well these programs work, since it can be hard to tell whether rain or snow after these operations would have fallen anyway. However, a 2018 study by Friedrich and her colleagues indicated that cloud seeding really can cause snow to fall, although it is unclear how much the technique can increase snow in various situations. The method is not used to control hurricanes. “There is no way that these storms underwent cloud seeding,” Friedrich said. Cloud seeding would not change the track of a weather system, she said. She explained that the technique “usually focuses on enhancing precipitation in precipitating clouds (rain or snow) and in breaking up large hailstones into smaller ones in thunderstorms to make them less impactful.” Nor have there been any experiments showing “cloud seeding in hurricanes produce more or less precipitation,” she said. The U.S. government did try to use cloud seeding to mitigate hurricanes at various points beginning in the 1940s and ending in 1983 — a fact referenced by social media posts and in a Gateway Pundit article shared by Greene. But there isn’t evidence these programs were effective at modifying hurricanes, and some results initially interpreted as successes did not pan out. The U.S. government also tried to secretly use cloud seeding to create extra rainfall and disrupt enemy supply chains during the Vietnam War, ultimately leading to an international treaty banning use of weather modification for military reasons. This history was also referenced in recent posts on weather modification, although it’s not clear whether this operation met its intended goal. Citing a 2013 interview with physicist Michio Kaku on CBS News that has previously been misinterpreted , Greene also brought up the idea that lasers could control the weather. But Jérôme Kasparian , a physicist at the University of Geneva who has researched using lasers to increase rainfall and modify the path of lightning, told us that initiating and maintaining a hurricane using lasers would not be possible. “You would need to manipulate amounts of energy that are completely beyond what you could do,” he said. Moreover, his own research on weather modification using lasers has been experimental, he said, and is not ready for routine use. “To the best of my knowledge the most advanced work in this direction with lasers is ours,” Kasparian said of his attempts to nudge clouds to produce rain with lasers. “We are far from getting raindrops,” he said, adding that his efforts to guide lightning with lasers also needs “a lot of work and development.” Finally, some posts referenced the High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks as a purported weather modification technique. But HAARP is a basic science research program aimed at understanding the highest parts of the atmosphere using radio waves. It has nothing to do with weather modification and could not alter hurricanes. “Radio waves in the frequency ranges that HAARP transmits are not absorbed in either the troposphere or the stratosphere—the two levels of the atmosphere that produce Earth’s weather,” says an FAQ page on the HAARP website. “Since there is no interaction, there is no way to control the weather.” Social media posts have also used the bogus claims about intentional weather modification as an opportunity to dismiss the reality of human-caused climate change. As we have written many times, heat-trapping greenhouse gases produced by human activities have warmed the planet, leading to a variety of climate effects. The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is complex , but rising global temperatures already have influenced and will continue to influence Atlantic hurricanes. Climate change causes sea level rise as hotter temperatures melt land ice and water warms and expands. Sea level rise, in combination with more coastal development, increases the risk of large storm surges and damage from hurricanes. Human-caused climate change has already elevated sea levels, and this has “very likely increased the impact of hurricanes relative to the case without sea level rise,” Knutson, the NOAA scientist, told us. Climate change is also expected to lead to more intense Atlantic hurricanes, meaning hurricanes with greater wind speeds. And it has already boosted extreme rainfall, since warmer air holds more moisture — and possibly contributed to an increase in rapidly intensifying hurricanes — although this is not certain. Knutson said climate change potentially impacted Helene and Milton in each of these ways. In the past, it was difficult to say whether and how climate change affected a particular storm, but increasingly, scientists are performing so-called attribution studies to quantify those impacts. Several preliminary assessments of Hurricane Helene have been released, connecting the “catastrophic impacts” of the hurricane to climate change . Each report has found that climate change increased the storm’s total rainfall, and of the two reports that assessed wind speeds, both found that climate change made the hurricane more intense. An early report on Hurricane Milton similarly indicated that climate change made the hurricane wetter and windier."

[/INST] The conspiracy theory movement known as QAnon has spread the baseless claim that former President Donald Trump is battling a child sex-trafficking ring led by prominent Democrats and Hollywood stars, as we’ve previously written. Trump’s role in the fight against sex trafficking is further distorted in a Feb. 26 Instagram post , which falsely claims Trump was the “1st President in U.S. History to acknowledge that children are being sold for sex in the U.S.” The post also wrongly claims President Joe Biden “rescinded Trump’s Executive Order that helped combat child sex trafficking” on Biden’s second day in office. The post received more than 2,000 likes. A replica of the claim, posted on the same day to Truth Social , received more than 1,500 likes. The claims aren’t new. On June 14, a Twitter user shared a clip of Jaco Booyens , an anti-sex trafficking activist, being interviewed on the conservative channel Real America’s Voice. Booyens claimed that Trump was the “first president in U.S. history to acknowledge that children are being sold for sex in this country [and] first president to open an office in the White House to form coalitions with law enforcement.” He also alleged that a Trump-era executive order on child sex trafficking was “rescinded [on] day two” of the Biden administration. None of the claims is accurate. Trump was not the first president to address the issue of child trafficking in the U.S. Ali Boak , director of the Global Center on Human Trafficking at Montclair State University, told FactCheck.org in an email interview that “many, if not all,” presidents since Bill Clinton “have taken steps to improve the United States’ response to address child sex trafficking,” due to the issue’s bipartisan support. Prior to addressing child sex trafficking, the federal government focused on combating sexual exploitation through legislation on child pornography. In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 into law. The act prohibited child pornography and outlawed transporting children across state lines for sexual exploitation. The law was then strengthened under President Ronald Reagan by the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984. On March 11, 1998, Clinton released a “Memorandum on Steps to Combat Violence Against Women and Trafficking in Women and Girls.” The State Department labeled it “the first presidential directive ever issued on the subject.” In the memorandum, Clinton said: “Here in the United States, we have seen cases of trafficking for the purposes of forced prostitution, sweatshop labor, and exploitative domestic servitude. … My Administration is committed to combating trafficking in women and girls with a focus on the areas of prevention, victim assistance and protection, and enforcement.” Clinton also signed into law the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 , or TVPA, which was the “first comprehensive federal law ” on the issue, according to the National Center for Homeless Education. The law noted, “Traffickers also buy children from poor families and sell them into prostitution or into various types of forced or bonded labor.” The TVPA officially codified labor and sex trafficking as criminal acts and established the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, which “partners with foreign governments, international organizations, other federal agencies, civil society, the private sector, and survivors of human trafficking to develop and implement effective strategies to confront human trafficking.” Marking the 20th anniversary of the act, Trump himself said on Jan. 31, 2020 that the victim protection act “took a historic step to protect the victims of this form of modern-day slavery here in the United States and all around the world.” In December 2008, President George W. Bush signed the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 . According to the Justice Department , the act mandated that “all unaccompanied alien children be screened as potential human trafficking victims” and eliminated prosecutorial requirements “to prove defendants knew a sex trafficking victim was a minor.” Bush also hosted the first national training conference on human trafficking in 2004 and established the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 2007. In May 2015, President Barack Obama signed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 , which codified human trafficking of minors and the production of child pornography as forms of “child abuse.” The law enabled the U.S. government to prosecute customers of sex trafficking victims. During the Obama administration, the Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons focused on prosecutorial capacity and victim-identification efforts in the U.S. Federal agencies “initiated over 6,000 human trafficking cases and secured over 4,000 convictions.” So U.S. presidents prior to Trump acknowledged and took steps to battle child sex trafficking. Regarding the claim that Biden rescinded a Trump order regarding trafficking, we found only one executive order from Trump that specifically addressed child sex trafficking in the Federal Register . On Jan. 31, 2020, Trump signed Executive Order 13903 , which sought to strengthen the federal government’s response to child sex trafficking given the potential for “twenty-first century technology and the proliferation of the internet and mobile devices” to facilitate the crime. But he did not “open an office in the White House to form coalitions with law enforcement,” nor did Biden rescind this order, as the Instagram post claims. As part of his policy, Trump announced “the Domestic Policy Council shall commit one employee position” — not an entire office — to fighting human trafficking in the U.S. “and to coordinate with personnel in other components of the Executive Office of the President.” But Luis C.deBaca , former ambassador-at-large to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons from 2009 to 2014, told FactCheck.org in a phone interview that the position had already existed. “The Domestic Policy Council and the National Security Council already had folks who were dedicated to staffing the human trafficking issue,” C.deBaca said. (The Domestic Policy Council itself was created by a 1993 executive order issued by Clinton.) Trump’s executive order also did not task the assigned Domestic Policy Council employee with “form[ing] coalitions with law enforcement,” as the posts suggest. (Trump did instruct some cabinet officers to partner with law enforcement and other stakeholders to “fund human trafficking and child exploitation prevention programs” and improve the government’s “capabilities to locate children who are missing.”) Biden never rescinded this or any other executive order on human trafficking on his second day in office, according to records from the Federal Register and White House briefing room . The misconception comes from the fact that, in establishing a new council to fight transnational criminal organizations, Biden revoked one section of a Trump-era executive order on human trafficking. In December 2021, Biden established a United States Council on Transnational Organized Crime, or USCTOC, to “lead whole-of-government efforts” on international organized crime.  In 2017, Trump had assigned the Threat Mitigation Working Group — which was established under Obama — the role of coordinating the federal government’s response to transnational criminal organizations. To avoid redundancy, the executive order that created the USCTOC also removed those same responsibilities from the Threat Mitigation Working Group. To do so, Biden had to revoke the section of Trump’s executive order that initially granted that authority to the Threat Mitigation Working Group. But this does not mean that Biden stopped the federal government’s efforts to end child sex trafficking, as the post claims. C.deBaca told FactCheck.org that a U.S. council is “something much bigger and more formal” than a working group, meaning Biden “elevated” the government’s response to transnational criminal organizations by creating the USCTOC. But C.deBaca cautioned against using presidential actions to mitigate transnational organized crime as the only metric for their efforts to combat human trafficking. While there is some overlap, “many people who are not members of transnational organized crime networks also do this,” he told us. C.deBaca pointed us to Biden’s 2021 National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking as “a real win” for federal government efforts to address the issue. The report amended an action plan with the same title that was released by the Trump administration in 2020. The two documents represent “a comprehensive plan” on human trafficking, which the U.S. did not have beforehand, according to C.deBaca. In December, Biden then signed the Countering Human Trafficking Act of 2021 into law, which granted the Center for Countering Human Trafficking, or the CCHT, statutory authority to coordinate the Department of Homeland Security’s response to human trafficking, expanding the center’s power. The bill also expanded victim assistance programs and transferred the Blue Campaign, a public awareness effort established in 2010 to combat human trafficking, to the CCHT — two policies that were supported by experts we interviewed. Amy Farrell , co-director of the Violence and Justice Research Lab at Northeastern University, commended the victim support services the law provides in a phone interview with FactCheck.org. According to her research, she said, “the more comprehensive a law is … particularly including victim services, the more likely there are to be prosecutions and identified victims.” Boak, of Montclair State, praised the Blue Campaign. She called the public awareness project “a critical tool against child sex trafficking as it provides public information and resources on the trafficking of children and youth.” Discussing the Biden administration’s efforts to address child sex trafficking, Carrie N. Baker , chair of American studies at Smith College, told us in an email interview that Biden’s “policies of providing support for poor families has done more to decrease young people’s vulnerability to trafficking than any previous president.” Booyens did not respond to a request for comment on the evidence behind his claims."

Right now we are projecting for the fiscal year that started July 1 a $1.2 billion surplus.\" The Legislature had to cut around $3.6 billion from the amount of money it was expected to have to spend in 2011-12. It wasn't a deficit -- which would mean the state didn't have the money to pay its bills -- but rather a projected shortfall. After making those cuts -- and cutting an additional $1 billion so it could beef up its reserves -- the state now has around $1.3 billion more than it needs to pay its bill as part of the 2011-12 budget. But having the extra money is actually common practice for the state. In fact, after Crist's last budget as governor, the state had an extra $433 million, or as Scott would say, a \"surplus.\" It also had a projected $3.6 billion shortfall. See the problem in making the comparison? In reality, the state ends most every year with what Scott calls a surplus because the state is required to pass a balanced budget and generally can't borrow money to pay its bills. And in recent years, because state revenue has been declining, the state enters the next year with a projected \"deficit\" using Scott's word -- or more accurately a shortfall.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Video Misinterprets Fauci’s Comments on COVID-19 Vaccine\". [/INST] A popular video that adds a voiceover to footage from a television interview with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci inaccurately questions the efficacy of one of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. “So the vaccine don’t protect you from covid ???” reads the Facebook video post title. In fact, as Fauci explained in the interview, the vaccine does protect against COVID-19 , which is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. It may not, however, protect against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which sometimes does not make people sick. The video , which has racked up more than 468,000 views and 14,000 shares, was posted by TAHO, a group that claims to be a non-governmental organization “to encourage the youth in farming activities.” The group’s Facebook photo includes an image of a map of Africa, and the group is managed by individuals in Ghana and the United Kingdom. Many of its posts, including the Fauci video post, end with the phrase, “African Youth Reflect.” The video runs about two minutes long and contains a segment of an interview CNN’s Chris Cuomo did with Fauci on Dec. 10. The interview followed news that an independent advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration had voted that the benefits of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outweigh its risks — all but ensuring the agency would greenlight the vaccine. The next day, the FDA followed through and granted the vaccine an emergency use authorization, the first for any COVID-19 vaccine in America. Another vaccine from the biotech company Moderna went through the same process a week later. That vaccine also protects against disease, but it’s not known yet if it prevents infection. The clip begins with Cuomo asking Fauci why it will still be necessary to wear a face mask even after a person is vaccinated. Fauci explains this is because while the vaccine does an excellent job at protecting people from falling ill, it might not prevent infection — and initially there will still be a lot of virus circulating in the population. “You could be prevented from getting clinical disease, and still have the virus that is in your nasopharynx because you could get infected,” he said. “We’re not sure, at this point, that the vaccine protects you against getting infected.” Here, a voiceover cuts in to repeat Fauci’s last sentence in a suggestive tone, before allowing him to continue: “We know for sure it’s very, very good, 94%, 95% in protecting you against clinically recognizable disease.” At this point a voiceover interjects, “Clinically recognizable disease, but not COVID?” The question insinuates that there is something suspicious about what Fauci said, but there isn’t. He’s only making a distinction between disease and infection. Specifically, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was tested in a phase 3 randomized trial in which people were counted as having COVID-19 if they developed at least one symptom of the disease, such as a fever, cough or shortness of breath, and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus within four days. Using this definition, which is quite inclusive, the vaccine was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease in adults. Moderna’s vaccine, for which the general results were known at the time of the CNN interview, was similarly effective — 94.1% — based on a COVID-19 case definition of at least two systemic symptoms, such as fever, chills or headache, and one respiratory symptom, along with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. The trials, however, did not immediately evaluate how well the vaccines were able to prevent infection. This is particularly relevant for COVID-19, because while many people develop at least some symptoms, some proportion of people do not. It therefore remains possible the two-dose shot keeps people healthy — the primary goal for the vaccines — but that vaccinated people can still become infected and unwittingly transmit the virus. Hence, Fauci’s advice, at least for now, to continue to wear a mask and follow public health precautions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also endorsed . As we’ve written before , there is a good chance that the authorized COVID-19 shots will help limit transmission to some degree, as that is still common with vaccines that cannot shield against infection but do defend against illness. But it nevertheless remains an open question for the COVID-19 vaccines. The video misleads again when the voiceover repeats Fauci’s statement that the vaccine protected people against “severe disease” and then asks, “Well, then, what does he call COVID, if that’s not serious?” That misunderstands COVID-19 and how differently it affects various people. As we’ve already noted, infection with SARS-CoV-2 does not always produce symptoms in people. For most individuals, the symptoms are relatively mild. But in some patients , particularly those who are older or who have certain health conditions, COVID-19 can be deadly — and for others, symptoms can linger . Fauci was referring to the ability of the vaccine to prevent a severe case of COVID-19. In both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials, severe disease was defined as having confirmed COVID-19 and at least one sign of serious illness, such as a blood oxygen level below 93%, respiratory failure or admission to the intensive care unit. In the Moderna trial, all 30 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred in the placebo group at the time of the FDA’s evaluation. One severe case was later identified in the vaccine group. Few volunteers in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial developed severe disease, making it difficult to come to firm conclusions, but as the FDA noted in its briefing , “the case split does suggest protection from severe COVID-19 disease.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Tucker Carlson Post Makes Unsupported Claim About Trump Jurors\". [/INST] On May 30, former President Donald Trump was convicted in Manhattan on 34 felony counts of business fraud. (For more about the conviction, read our article “ Q&A on Trump’s Criminal Conviction .”) As with all criminal prosecutions , the jury had to be unanimous in its verdict to find Trump guilty on each count. Close to 300 people were initially screened as potential jurors and alternates, according to NPR . Dozens were dismissed after telling the court they could not be impartial, as the BBC reported , and those who remained were “grilled on 42 questions in the jury questionnaire, including on their news-reading habits, whether they had attended any Trump rallies or read any of the former president’s books.” A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates was finalized on April 19 after four days of selection. In a letter attached to the questionnaire, acting Justice Juan Merchan of the New York Supreme Court told lawyers for both sides that the jurors could not be asked about their party affiliations. “Contrary to defense counsel’s arguments,” Merchan went on to say , “the purpose of jury selection is not to determine whether a prospective juror likes or does not like one of the parties. Such questions are irrelevant because they do not go to the issue of the prospective juror’s qualifications.” But conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson posted an unsupported claim on social media that the jury was “stacked” with people who voted for President Joe Biden. In a June 13 Facebook post , Carlson claimed, without evidence, that “Trump was found guilty by a jury stacked with Biden voters…” The post received more than 98,000 likes as of July 10. In the midst of jury selection, conservative political activist Laura Loomer made a similar claim. She posted on X, “Today, on day 2 of jury selection, six jurors were chosen for Trump’s trial. Several are open Biden supporters. RIGGED TRIAL!” Her post, uploaded on April 16, received more than 15,000 likes. The claims about the jurors’ political leanings are unsupported, however. As we explained, the judge did not allow jurors to be questioned about political affiliation, so that information was not made public, and they were screened in an attempt to ensure their impartiality. Jurors were selected from Manhattan, where the Trump Organization is located , the business fraud occurred and the indictment was filed. Trump argued that it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial in the heavily Democratic borough, but his lawyers failed to convince a federal judge to move the case to federal court – which could have given Trump “a broader, more politically diverse jury pool,” as the Associated Press explained . During the jury selection process, potential jurors were “grilled on their social media posts, personal lives and political views as the lawyers and judge search for any bias that would prevent them from being impartial,” the Associated Press reported. Furthermore, Trump’s legal team had the ability to challenge jurors who they felt were unfit to provide impartial judgment and reject up to 10 jurors without cause. “Prospective jurors can be dismissed by the judge for cause if he finds they shouldn’t serve on the panel,” as CNN reported. “Prosecutors and Trump’s defense team will also get 10 peremptory strikes they can use to remove a juror from the pool, no questions asked.” Trump claimed that 10 strikes were not enough to ensure a fair jury. During the selection process, Vox reported, “Potential jurors have been asked to read out or explain posts or memes they’ve shared, and at least  one was dismissed for sharing a post that included the words ‘lock him up,’ in reference to Trump.” Two jurors were dismissed after expressing that they could not provide a fair judgment. The New York Times reported, “One seated juror said she had developed concerns her identity could be revealed. The second was dismissed after prosecutors raised concerns about his credibility.” The decision not to disclose the jurors’ names was made by both prosecutors and Trump’s defense team. In March, Merchan accepted prosecutors’ argument that most information about the jurors should be sealed, and Trump’s lawyers largely agreed. And, as we said earlier, jurors could not be asked about their party affiliations and voting habits during the jury selection process. But information about their jobs and thoughts about the trial have been published in news articles, including in the New York Times and the Guardian . Information made public included their sources of news, levels of education, marital statuses and areas of residence. All jurors pledged to remain fair and impartial. Cynthia Godsoe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, told us in an email that there is “no validity at all to the claim that [the jurors] were biased. The defense had ample opportunity to question the jurors, research their social media (in fact several were dismissed for things they said there) and exercise the usual amount of challenges (peremptory and for cause) to get rid of jurors they didn’t want.” “No jury can be totally free of opinions, [especially] in a high-profile case like this, and the question really is, can the juror be fair and impartial,” Godsoe said. “Those left on the jury passed this test for the judge and, more importantly to Trump’s after-the-fact complaints, to HIS own lawyers.” Lawyers are typically barred from asking jurors about their political party and religion, Godsoe explained, stating that ballots cast in U.S. elections are always anonymous and no voting in the U.S. is public. In this case, Trump’s lawyers “were not allowed to ask which party they voted for, but were allowed to ask about voting generally, i.e. did they vote,” Godsoe said. In the Times article, some jurors did express feelings of antipathy toward Trump but said that they felt able to remain impartial. Juror 11, for example, a product manager who lives in Upper Manhattan, said, “I don’t like his persona, how he presents himself in public.” She then added, “I don’t like some of my co-workers, but I don’t try to sabotage their work.” Juror 5 , on the other hand, had more positive feelings about Trump. “President Trump speaks his mind,” the New York Times quoted her as saying. Juror 2 , who works in finance and lives in Hell’s Kitchen, said he believed “Trump had done some good for the country,” the New York Times reported. So, some of the jurors did express positive feelings about Trump. Their political affiliations and voting records — and those of the other jurors — remain unknown. Merchan had scheduled sentencing for July 11, but delayed it until Sept. 18 following the U.S. Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling that grants Trump some immunity from criminal prosecution. The court ruled that presidents have a “presumption of immunity” when carrying out “official acts,” but “no immunity for his unofficial acts.” Although it’s unclear what impact the Supreme Court ruling might have on Trump’s conviction, the federal judge who last year rejected Trump’s attempt to move the trial to federal court wrote in his decision that Trump’s actions in this case were “not related to a President’s official acts.” “The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the President — a cover-up of an embarrassing event,” U.S. District Court Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein wrote in a July 19, 2023, opinion. “Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a President’s official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the President’s official duties.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Oregon Fire Trucks Fighting L.A. Blazes Didn’t Require ‘Emissions Testing’\". [/INST] The wildfires raging since last week in the Los Angeles area have killed at least 24 people , consumed over 62 square miles, destroyed thousands of homes and displaced more than 150,000 people. The National Weather Service predicted severe wind gusts again this week in Los Angeles and Ventura counties that could intensify and spread the fires, the Los Angeles Times reported. To assist its neighbor, the Oregon State Fire Marshal has sent 370 firefighters, 75 fire engines, 30 water tenders that carry water to a fire line and other equipment to Southern California. But social media posts have spread the false claim that California has delayed the deployment of Oregon’s equipment in order to inspect the trucks’ emissions and ensure they meet state environmental requirements. Conservative activist Dinesh D’Souza, who has previously spread election misinformation , posted on X on Jan. 11 claiming, “Oregon sent 60 fire trucks to California to help with the fires, but they’re being held in Sacramento for emissions testing. You can’t make this up! What is going on?!” The post, which included a video of a man attributing that information to a publication called the Santa Monica Observer, received more than 1.3 million views as of Jan. 13, according to the platform. The Santa Monica Observer, which has posted false news and dubious information in the past, according to the Los Angeles Times , wrote that its “original story was based on a tweet that has since been deleted” and said that it “can verify that there are fire fighters and vehicles from all over the Western US, fighting fires on the Westside now.” A Jan. 12 Threads post also claimed, “The state of Oregon sent 60 fire trucks to California to assist with the wild fires. However they have not arrived. Why? All 60 fire trucks were stopped in Sacramento because (get this) they [didn’t] have a California Smog Emission test. So they are all currently in Sacramento, awaiting a smog test and have not gotten it yet. California is dead serious.” A factsheet compiled by the office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom to address misinformation about the fires said D’Souza’s claim is wrong. The factsheet says, “out-of-state fire trucks take part in 15 minute safety & equipment inspection to ensure no issues with the vehicle. At the time of the original post, the Oregon firefighting teams were already in the Los Angeles area battling the blazes.” In addition, Newsom said in a Jan. 11 post on X, “Oregon has courageously sent CA some of their best firefighters and equipment — all have been here for days fighting these blazes. To say otherwise is not only incorrect, it’s offensive to the brave men and women who are fighting on the frontlines right now.” The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or CAL Fire, posted a video on Jan. 11 showing the safety inspection process for out-of-state vehicles assisting in the firefighting efforts. In an email to FactCheck.org, Kassie Keller, a spokesperson for the Oregon State Fire Marshal, also said the social media claim “is not true; no emissions testing took place.” Keller directed us to a Jan. 12 statement on Facebook issued by the Oregon fire marshal, which said, in part: “We want to clear up confusion about our Oregon firefighters and equipment sent to California to help with the wildfires. There is misinformation spreading on social media and from some news outlets claiming our equipment had to pass emissions tests and our equipment and firefighters were turned away or delayed. TO BE CLEAR: THIS IS FALSE. “Our firefighters left Oregon mid-morning on Wednesday (1/8) from various locations in the state. These strike teams traveled to Sacramento where they stayed the night. On Thursday (1/9) at 6 a.m., they went through a routine safety check with CAL Fire to make sure the engines were mechanically sound. CAL Fire posted on their social media channels detailing the process. “Our strike teams were scheduled to arrive in Southern California on Thursday. There was no delay in the process or travel. Our equipment is held to the highest safety standard to ensure the safety of our firefighters. This equipment also does not regularly travel hundreds of miles at a time. Firefighter safety is our number one priority. “No engine was turned away. They all completed the safety check, and all 15 strike teams arrived in Southern California on Thursday and began their 24-hour shift early Friday morning,” the Oregon fire marshal’s statement said. The state of California has some of the strictest vehicle emissions requirements in the U.S., according to the Kelley Blue Book. But the state has not required the Oregon fire equipment to undergo smog tests before assisting in the battle against the Los Angeles area wildfires, as some social media posts have claimed."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"$770 Payments Are Just One Form of Federal Aid to L.A. Fire Victims\". [/INST] The wildfires burning in Southern California since Jan. 7 have killed at least 24 people and destroyed thousands of homes and other buildings, displacing about 180,000 people. Among the federal assistance programs available to victims of the California wildfires is a $770 emergency payment to cover the cost of immediate necessities like food, fuel and baby formula. Those payments are available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s new Serious Needs Assistance program, which President Joe Biden referenced during a briefing with federal officials on Jan. 13. Later that evening, an X account managed by President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee posted a clip from the briefing and highlighted the portion of Biden’s comments that said, “People impacted by these fires are gonna receive one-time payment of $770. One-time payment.” That clip was reposted by some widely followed conservative accounts that misleadingly compared the emergency payments of $770 for California’s wildfire victims to either millions or billions in U.S. aid for Ukraine. Those posts leave the misleading impression that the emergency payments would be the only aid available to those affected by the fires, implying that U.S. aid to people in another country unfairly outpaced domestic aid. The clip of Biden racked up about 7 million views between two of these posts and the RNC’s alone. The suggestive claim that victims of the fires would receive only $770 from the federal government soon migrated to other platforms, where users compared the emergency relief payments to funding for the war in Ukraine and Israel’s war in Gaza . But, as we said, the $770 emergency payment is just one of the federal aid programs available to victims in California. The emergency payment is available through the Serious Needs Assistance program that was introduced in January 2024. “Serious Needs Assistance is a flexible, upfront payment that can be used to pay for emergency supplies like water, food, first aid, breast-feeding supplies, infant formula, diapers, personal hygiene items, or fuel for transportation,” according to a fact sheet published by FEMA in October. “This is only one form of assistance the Federal Emergency Management Agency offers,” Jayce Genco, a spokesperson for FEMA, told us in a phone interview. “It’s not the only assistance that folks could be eligible for.” Genco provided a list of other programs available to California fire victims, including rental assistance, home repair or replacement, and medical expense assistance. And, for those interested in the full context of Biden’s remarks , he first specified that federal agencies would help pay for general costs associated with fighting the fires and addressing their destruction. “The federal government is going to cover 100% of the cost, for the next 180 days, for things like firefighter overtime pay, debris removal, temporary shelters,” he said. “It’s going to cost tens of billions of dollars to get Los Angeles back to where it was, so we’re going to need Congress to step up to provide funding.” The president then mentioned the emergency program available to individuals who are affected. “I want to be clear — we’re not waiting until those fires are over to start helping the victims. We’re getting them help right now, as you all know,” he said. “People impacted by these fires are going to receive a one-time payment of $770 — one-time payment — so they can quickly purchase things like water, baby formula and prescriptions. So far, nearly 6,000 survivors have registered to do just that and $5.1 million has gone out.” This isn’t the first time that political influencers have suggested that the federal government was providing only one form of assistance to disaster victims. We wrote about similar claims that circulated in October following the devastation from Hurricane Helene. The claims aren’t correct this time around either."

[/INST] The number of apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the U.S. border with Mexico increased by 317% during President Joe Biden’s first 10 full months in office, compared with the same period in 2020. With midterm elections fast approaching, immigration has been a hot topic for Republicans seeking congressional office. But a video posted on Facebook on Jan. 30 — and shared on Twitter by Republican State Rep. Anthony Sabatini of Florida — isn’t an example of illegal immigration. The video made on Jan. 28 in a hotel parking lot in Maitland, Florida, falsely claimed to show “ 4 busloads of illegals being dropped off from the Southern Border… All 18-25 year old able-bodied men… given credit cards of American tax dollars and a place to stay.” The video was posted by The Red, White and Blue, a page that self-identifies as advocating for “ GOD, COUNTRY, GUTS AND TRUTH – no matter how ugly the Truth maybe . ” The post amassed about 1,000 views. On Twitter, the video received more than a 170,000 views and was shared by Sabatini on Jan. 30. Sabatini, who is a candidate in Florida’s 7th Congressional District, added text that read, “Hundreds of illegals were just SHIPPED into my congressional district yesterday—dropped off in Maitland. We MUST stop & DEPORT them immediately…” The social media claims were followed on Jan. 31 by a protest by dozens of people outside the Maitland hotel. But the workers seen in the video were not “illegals.” They were in the U.S. legally as contract laborers for Dewar Nurseries, a wholesale plant nursery in Apopka, Florida. Attorneys for Dewar Nurseries released a statement to Click Orlando News, saying : “The workers employed by Dewar Nurseries who reside at the Extended Stay Hotel in Maitland are here in the United States under the H2A Visa program. This is a long-standing, 100-percent legitimate program that allows our companies to hire the workers we need to deliver the best-quality products to our customers. Any suggestion to the contrary is mistaken.” The H-2A program “allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs,” according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Apopka Mayor Bryan Nelson also told a Click Orlando News reporter that 90 to 100 people who were staying at the Extended Stay Hotel in Maitland all have H-2A visas.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"DeSantis, Social Media Posts Mislead on COVID-19’s Toll in Florida\". [/INST] In early November, the U.S. surpassed 750,000 deaths due to COVID-19 and has had more than 46 million cases since the pandemic began. Florida has the 10th highest cumulative case rate of the pandemic, according to federal, state and local data compiled by the New York Times .  The steady decline in cases has led to sunny social media posts proclaiming Florida has the “ lowest Covid rates in the country without having to institute communist mandates & lockdowns .” “Florida now has the lowest COVID case rate and California is middle of the pack,” reads the screenshot of a tweet from California Republican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley. “Isn’t it interesting how an all-important metric suddenly no longer matters.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also touted his state’s recent COVID-19 data d uring an Oct. 29 interview on Fox News’ “ Ingraham Angle.” Host Laura Ingraham introduced DeSantis by saying, “Florida is one of the big COVID success stories that the media would prefer to ignore altogether. Now, the Sunshine State now has one of the lowest daily case and death rates out there.” DeSantis replied: “ I guess Florida is no longer part of the United States. They just pretend like we don’t exist.” He also said, “Now that we’re in a situation we have very low numbers, you don’t hear a peep.” The social media posts and DeSantis are correct that Florida’s daily COVID-19 case rate is currently low. But what’s left unsaid is that Florida’s total case rate is still higher than the national rate and among the highest in the U.S. As of Nov. 5, the seven-day average of COVID-19 cases for Florida was 7 cases per 100,000 people, according to the Times database as of Nov. 5. Florida was tied with Louisiana for the fewest daily cases per 100,000 among the 50 states. But, as our chart below illustrates, Florida has the 10th highest case rate — more than 17,000 per 100,000 people — when measured by its total number of cases during the pandemic, as of Nov. 5. That’s higher than the national case rate of 13,995 per 100,000 people.  According to data compiled by the New York Times, Florida — the third largest state — has the third most COVID-19 deaths and cases in the nation, with more than 3.6 million cases and more than 59,000 deaths since February 2020. When adjusted for population, Florida’s COVID-19 death rate also ranks 10th among the 50 states, with 278 deaths per 100,000 people. Florida’s recent rise and decline of cases fit a pattern that health experts have seen with other variants , where cases peak and decline over a two-month cycle. “There’s this weird two-month thing that goes on. We all picked it up,” Michael Sweat, a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leader of its COVID-19 tracking team, said in a university blog post. “I mean, it’s like every time when you get a wave, it goes up, peaks and declines in about two months.” Florida — along with Tennessee, Oklahoma, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas and Kentucky — followed this trend, as cases started to rise in late June and began to fall in August. Only Kentucky’s seven-day average case rate is higher than the U.S. seven-day average rate, as of Nov. 5.

[/INST] The American Red Cross has made clear that people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to give blood if they are feeling healthy. The Food and Drug Administration guidelines for blood establishments say that people who were vaccinated with any of the COVID-19 vaccines approved or authorized for use in the U.S. — Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech or Johnson & Johnson — do not need to wait any time between vaccination and donation, as long as they’re feeling healthy and have a normal temperature.  The FDA guidance says that only people who do not know what type of vaccine they received or got vaccinated with a live attenuated COVID-19 vaccine would need to wait two weeks after vaccination to give blood. Currently, there are no live attenuated COVID-19 vaccines, which contain a live but weakened virus, authorized or approved for use by the FDA or the World Health Organization. The Red Cross also requires a two- to four-week wait for donors who received other live attenuated vaccines, such as the vaccine for measles or yellow fever, “out of an abundance of caution.” People who want to give blood should carry their vaccination card with the name of the vaccine manufacturer at the time of making a donation. “You may still donate blood, platelets or plasma after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine,” the Red Cross says on a website addressing blood donations and the coronavirus. Yet, posts on social media continue to mislead about the eligibility of vaccinated people to give blood, and about the way the Red Cross uses those donations. “sooooo Red Cross won’t use vaxxed blood ?? did I hear this correct??? I mean   this is normal right? nothing to see here?  and frankly I should know if I’m being given contaminated blood    no?,” reads one post published on Facebook on April 20. As we said, that is not correct. “[T]he American Red Cross accepts and uses donations from vaccinated people,” a spokesperson for the American Red Cross told us in an email. “Blood donations from individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are not ‘contaminated’ and are safe for blood transfusion. The COVID-19 vaccine is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream.” The Red Cross told us the organization does not label blood donations based on vaccination status given that vaccination itself does not make blood unsafe. People who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can also donate blood 10 days after complete resolution of symptoms or 10 days after testing positive for COVID-19 if they did not develop symptoms, according to the FDA guidance . “Respiratory viruses, in general, are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2, worldwide,” the FDA says in its guidance ."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Faulty Research Paper Leads to Unfounded Claims About Health of Atlantic Ocean\". [/INST] The world’s oceans have changed over the last several decades. Climate change has warmed the surface water and caused the sea level to rise, for example. But some social media accounts that post about environmental issues have made the unfounded claim, “Plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone.” Plankton — the catchall term for small marine plants, phytoplankton, and animals, zooplankton — serve two vital functions in the ecosystem. They are a major source of food for other marine life, and they absorb carbon dioxide while creating oxygen in the ocean. So, if the claim were true it would, indeed, be a major environmental catastrophe. But experts who study plankton have not found that to be the case. “We absolutely haven’t seen the drops that were noted” in the social media posts, David Johns , head of the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey, told us in an email. “[I]n fact, in some areas there have been increases in plankton,” he said. The CPR Survey has been recording marine ecological data since 1931 and is now run by the Marine Biological Association in the U.K. We’ll explain how the inaccurate claim about plankton developed. It’s based on a quote from Howard Dryden , a marine biologist in Scotland who has, for most of his career, developed and distributed water treatment systems. In 2021, Dryden sought help from fellow members of the Ocean Cruising Club to gather water samples as part of a citizen science project. He wrote in a March 11, 2021, announcement calling for volunteers, “There are around 5,000 yachts crossing oceans every year, from Arctic regions to the equator. If some of these yachts were to start collecting data, then it would be invaluable for the measurement of oceanic pollution and productivity.” Three months later he posted a report suggesting that the primary problem facing ocean ecosystems was chemical and plastic pollution and, about a year after that, on May 6, he posted a paper titled: “Climate change…have we got it all wrong? an observational report by a Marine Biologist.” The abstract for that paper concluded, “peer reviewed literature shows we have lost more than 50% of all life in the oceans, but from own plankton sampling activity and other observations, we consider that losses closer to 90% have occurred, and these are due to chemical pollution from, for example, wastewater and not climate change.” The paper was cited in a July 17 article published by a Scottish newspaper, the Sunday Post, which also quoted extensively from an interview with Dryden. Among the quotes was this, referring to plankton: “ Our results confirmed a 90% reduction in primary productivity in the Atlantic. Effectively, the Atlantic Ocean is now pretty much dead.” Shortly after the article was published, the claim that “plankton in the Atlantic Ocean is 90% gone” began circulating widely online. Ars Technica was among the first to address the claim and, after it published a story explaining that the claim was overstated, Dryden contacted the publication and said that the Sunday Post article should have reported a “90% reduction in marine plankton in the Equatorial Atlantic, not the whole Atlantic.” Dryden also changed the name of his May 6 paper to include the “equatorial Atlantic” distinction. It’s now titled : “Climate Change…Equatorial Atlantic Ocean plankton productivity and Caribbean pollution….a think piece for debate.” The newspaper updated its story and included an editor’s note at the bottom explaining the changes. The equatorial Atlantic includes currents flowing west from North Africa toward the southeast coast of the U.S. near the equator, as the name suggests. That area doesn’t typically have high numbers of visible plankton, though. “Equatorial waters are naturally not hotspots for plankton (unless you look at the really small stuff, like pico- and nanoplankton, which you cannot see with a typical microscope),” Johns, of the CPR Survey, told us. “So the claims are unfounded.” Johns also noted the reference in Dryden’s paper to a global loss of 50% of plankton, and disagreed with that, too. “I work with a large number of national and international plankton scientists,” Johns said, “and no one is reporting those sorts of declines – a decline in that order would be absolutely catastrophic, so many marine organisms depend on plankton, from larval through to adult fish, whales, whale sharks, manta rays, sea birds etc. And the phytoplankton are massively important as global producers of oxygen, and they ‘drawdown’ and fix CO2.” The larger premise of Dryden’s paper — that climate change isn’t much of a threat — is inaccurate, too. Looking at the anticipated impacts of climate change on the ocean alone, we can expect increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise, changes in climate patterns due to higher ocean temperatures that affect the currents, and decreased marine biodiversity as higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide acidify the water. “We have seen lots of changes relating to climate change, specifically the warming of the sea surface,” Johns said, addressing Dryden’s specific claim about the amount of plankton in the equatorial Atlantic. “In many cases, this has forced some plankton groups to retract northwards into cooler waters, and has allowed warming loving species to advance northwards as conditions for them become more favourable.” So, the claim that 90% of plankton has disappeared from the Atlantic is based on a faulty paper that was highlighted by a news outlet. Those who study the issue have found cause for concern about the impacts of climate change, but they haven’t clocked the magnitude of decline trumpeted in the viral social media claim.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Misinterpret Biden on mRNA Cancer Vaccines\". [/INST] The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are the first vaccines using the messenger RNA technology to be approved for use, but they’re not the first ever developed. The history of mRNA vaccines started decades before the pandemic, and included research on mRNA cancer vaccines. Unlike platforms used in other vaccines, the mRNA technology doesn’t directly introduce an antigen, such as a protein, into the body to trigger an immune response . Instead, mRNA encapsuled in a fatty envelope delivers instructions for cells to make proteins. The immune system responds by producing antibodies and immune cells, preparing the body to respond if it encounters these proteins again. The research on cancer mRNA vaccines both enabled the development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and was accelerated by it. Now, several clinical trials are testing mRNA vaccines to fight different kinds of cancers — and some have shown promising early results. President Joe Biden referred to this success in his State of the Union address on March 7. “The pandemic no longer controls our lives,” he said . “The vaccine that saved us from COVID is — are now being used to beat cancer. Turning setback into comeback. That’s what America does.” The president’s message wasn’t entirely clear. He was referring to the technology used to create the COVID-19 vaccines, not the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. Biden’s imprecise wording allowed opponents of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to twist his message on social media , where users misinterpreted Biden’s statement to claim the president was announcing the same vaccines used for COVID-19 were now being used to fight cancer. “BREAKING: Biden announces that the COVID vaccine is now being used to cure cancer,” an Instagram user wrote on March 8. Similarly, comedian and conservative commentator Terrence K. Williams posted a Rumble video on Facebook titled, “JESUS!! Biden said the Covid Vaccine is being used to cure CANCER!!” Comments on the social media posts repeated the unsupported claim that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer. As we’ve explained extensively , there’s no evidence to support that theory. Philip Santangelo , a professor and cancer researcher at Emory University, told us he didn’t “think President Biden meant that literally” since COVID-19 vaccines “won’t help with cancer.” But Santangelo, who is leading a $24 million mRNA collaborative project funded by the federal government, said some of “the parts and pieces” of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine — the mRNA platform — is being used in cancer vaccines to train the immune system to fight the disease. “He wasn’t wrong,” Santangelo told us in a phone interview in reference to Biden’s words. “I mean, you are still using that technology, but you’re not using it in exactly the same way.” In fact, in August, when announcing the funding for Santangelo’s project, called Curing the Uncurable via RNA-Encoded Immunogene Tuning, as part of the White House Cancer Moonshot initiative, Biden used similar, but more detailed, language. “Over the past few years, COVID-19 vaccines developed using mRNA technology have saved millions of lives around the world,” Biden said at the time. “Now, a skilled team at Emory University in Atlanta will work to adapt these technologies to turn more cancers into curable diseases. This is a bold endeavor that has the potential to transform the fight against cancer and other difficult diagnoses.” Although no mRNA cancer vaccine has been authorized or approved for use yet, many are being studied to treat different kinds of cancers. “There are dozens, if not hundreds, of ideas of how the platform could be used for cancer,” Dr. James A. Hoxie , emeritus professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and co-director of the Penn Institute of RNA Innovation, told us, referring to the potential of mRNA. Therapies using mRNA rely on decades of research, in which scientists have learned how to modify RNA and package it in vesicles of fat, or lipid nanoparticles , to protect the RNA from premature degradation. COVID-19 took the mRNA platform to “the next level,” Santangelo told us, by accelerating the manufacturing process and its scalability. The COVID-19 pandemic also created the opportunity to test the platform’s safety and efficacy in large clinical trials and evaluate the vaccines’ performance in real life. “The production of mRNA vaccines today is easy, fast, and can be scaled up as needed,” Norbert Pardi , assistant professor of microbiology at Penn Medicine and lead of the vaccine group at the Penn Institute for RNA Innovation, told Cancer Currents, the National Cancer Institute’s blog. Investigational cancer vaccines use the same mRNA tool as their COVID-19 predecessors — a lipid nanoparticle with RNA inside. What changes is the information the mRNA is delivering to cells. (The cancer vaccines also differ from the COVID-19 vaccines in that they’re therapeutic, meaning they’re intended to treat people who have already been diagnosed with cancer.) Hoxie compared it to looking at two different pills that look the same, but treat different diseases. “Under a microscope, a lipid nanoparticle for COVID would look like a lipid nanoparticle to treat pancreatic cancer,” he said. “It looks the same, but they’re different.” COVID-19 vaccines instruct cells to make spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease. For the cancer vaccines, scientists are using this technology to instruct cells to produce proteins that are unique to cancer cells and not present in normal cells – specifically, tumor-specific antigens and neoantigens , new proteins that occur in cancer cells when they have mutated. Both can serve as good targets for vaccines and other immunotherapy because when the immune system sees these unfamiliar antigens, the body mounts a response and produces cytotoxic T cells that destroy tumor cells. “Essentially, you can direct your immune system — that’s why it’s called a vaccine — to kill tumor cells,” Santangelo, who is working on different vaccine models for different kinds of tumors, told us. “mRNA is just a relatively simple way to get cells to make proteins you want them to make, that’s it,” he said. “It’s a convenient platform that can be used to either, again, introduce cancer antigen to the immune system or express things like cytokines,” which are small proteins “that can help wake the immune system and get it revved up to go kill tumor cells.” But the development of these cancer vaccines is challenging. The diversity of tumors and antigens is one issue. Each cancer is different, and people’s cancers have unique combinations of mutations. To address this, researchers have been trying to use mRNA that can instruct cells to produce personalized neoantigens . The mRNA is manufactured after identifying mutations in samples from a patient’s cancerous cells. The process for making a personalized mRNA vaccine usually takes between one and two months, and the vaccine can include the genetic code for up to 34 different neoantigens, according to the National Cancer Institute. One of the promising vaccine candidates in the pipeline is Merck and Moderna’s personalized mRNA cancer vaccine, known as mRNA-4157 or V940, which targets melanoma, the most serious kind of skin cancer. In a phase 2 clinical trial that involved 157 high-risk patients who had undergone surgery, 50 received the standard treatment (pembrolizumab) and 107 received standard treatment and the vaccine. Results published in January show that recurrence-free survival, which the trial was primarily intended to measure, was longer with the combination of both therapies. The rate of recurrence or death over around two years of follow-up was 22% for those who received the vaccine versus 40% for those who did not. The most common side effects from the vaccine were fatigue, chills and pain at the injection site. In July, the companies announced a phase 3 trial, which plans to enroll “1,089 patients at more than 165 sites in over 25 countries around the world.” “I have every confidence that this strategy will be expanded to … non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, hepatocellular cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, et cetera,” Dr. Jeffrey S. Weber , deputy director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone and a trial researcher, said at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, according to Medscape. A second promising personalized mRNA vaccine , developed by BioNTech and Genentech, targets one of the most common and deadliest types of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . In a phase 1 trial , of patients who have had surgery, 15 patients were treated with a drug called atezolizumab , nine doses of a vaccine with up to 20 personalized neoantigens and standard chemotherapy drugs for pancreatic cancer. According to the results, the vaccine activated a strong T cell response against the neoantigens in half of the patients. These patients had a longer recurrence-free survival compared with those who didn’t show a T cell expansion. A phase 2 trial of the vaccine, called autogene cevumeran, started in October 2023 and hopes to enroll 260 participants in nearly 80 sites around the world. “The evidence from the phase 1 trial showed that we are on the right track: An mRNA vaccine can trigger T cells to recognize pancreatic cancers as foreign,” Dr. Vinod Balachandran , who led a team from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, said in a report from the center. “Moreover, the vaccines stimulated many such T cells, and we continued to detect T cells stimulated by such vaccines in patients up to two years later.” Hoxie told us the results of these trials were impressive. “In each case, it was an RNA vaccine platform that was generating an immune response that was capable of blunting, of decreasing the chance for relapse. So, what’s going to happen over time? Is that just delaying it, or is it really, totally preventing it? And, that’s what’s going to have to be seen,” he said. “But it gives you an idea why there’s excitement in the field — because you’ve done something with a vaccine that is changing the standard of care.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"False Claim About Cause of Autism Highlighted on Pennsylvania Senate Panel\". [/INST] Evidence has shown that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine commonly given to children isn’t related to the development of autism. Rather, autism is understood to be caused by a combination of factors — some genetic and some environmental — although the disorder is still being studied. The environmental factors that can increase the risk of autism include advanced age of either parent and complications during birth, according to recent research. Vaccination is not a contributing factor. But the false claim about vaccination and autism has been circulating since 1998, when a since-retracted paper wrongly suggested the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. Data presented in the paper were later found to be fabricated . The General Medical Council in the United Kingdom stripped the lead author of his ability to practice medicine for his dishonesty and irresponsibility in the paper. But the baseless claim has remained. It was recently repeated on a “ medical freedom panel ” hosted by Doug Mastriano — a Pennsylvania state senator who has made dubious claims about COVID-19 vaccines. Among those on his June 9 panel was Steve Kirsch , an entrepreneur who is not a doctor or medical expert. Kirsch referenced the well-worn falsehood linking the MMR vaccine to autism, but broadened it to suggest that vaccines, generally, cause a host of ailments as well as gender dysphoria and homosexuality. He told legislators , “The Amish are a perfect example of a large group of people who are largely unvaccinated and there’s no autism — we can’t find an autistic kid who was unvaccinated. It’s very, very rare. In the Amish community — very, very rare. You won’t find transsexuals. You won’t find homosexuals. You won’t find kids with ADD, with autoimmune disease, with PANDAS/PANS, with epilepsy. You just don’t find any of these chronic diseases in the Amish.” Clips from this portion of the panel are now circulating on social media . Since Kirsch has also repeated the specific claim about MMR vaccines, we’ll first address his claim that “we can’t find an autistic kid who was unvaccinated.” Studies have shown that the rate of autism present in children who were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella compared with those who were never vaccinated is the same. A 2019 paper found that children who were given the MMR vaccine were diagnosed with autism at about the same rate as those who weren’t. That study “strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination,” its authors wrote. As early as 2004, there was already evidence that vaccines did not cause autism. An Immunization Safety Review Committee’s report published that year by the National Academy of Sciences concluded “that the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism.” Many studies since then have also shown similar findings. So, Kirsch need only look to those studies to find examples of unvaccinated children who developed autism. His suggestion that the disorder is less common among unvaccinated children is wrong. As for Kirsch’s claim that in addition to autism, gender dysphoria, homosexuality, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autoimmune diseases, Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Streptococcal Infections ( PANDAS ) and Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome ( PANS ), and epilepsy are virtually nonexistent among the Amish because they are unvaccinated — that’s not right, either. First of all, Kirsch makes the unsupported assumption that the Amish community is “largely unvaccinated.” It’s hard to know what the vaccination rate is among the Amish community as a whole because there is no data available on that. But research on some Amish groups has shown that children are vaccinated. One paper from 2017 that studied an Amish community in northern Ohio found that 98% of the parents surveyed had immunized their children in whole or in part. Another paper from 2011 found that, of the parents surveyed, 85% had vaccinated at least some of their children. Also, it’s worth noting that a 2010 conference paper studied autism among the Amish, specifically, which shows that the disorder does exist within that community. The paper said, “Preliminary data have identified the presence of ASD in the Amish community at a rate of approximately 1 in 271 children using standard ASD screening and diagnostic tools although some modifications may be in order.” That rate was lower than the general population, the paper noted, but that could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in how caregivers answered screening questions or genetic differences. Even if autism is less common among the Amish, there is no evidence that it has anything to do with vaccination — and indeed, numerous studies contradict such an interpretation. Second, on the suggestion that vaccines cause people to become “transsexuals,” as Kirsch said — we’ve written before about the similar false claim that standard childhood vaccination causes gender dysphoria , which is the distress felt by some transgender individuals since their sex assigned at birth doesn’t match their gender identity. There’s also no evidence to support the claim that vaccination is responsible for causing heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality, either. But Kirsch isn’t the first to make the claim. QAnon conspiracy theorists in 2021 spread the claim that vaccines could make children homosexual after an Iranian cleric with a history of spreading fake COVID-19 cures — Abbas Tabrizian — posted about it on Telegram. Kirsch’s suggestion that various ailments are caused by vaccines is similarly unsupported by evidence. For example, his suggestion that “ADD” — or attention-deficit disorder, which is the old name for what is now called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, ADHD — is a result of vaccines is also wrong. There have been three large studies that have examined the risk that vaccines could cause ADHD. In particular, two of those studies looked at the effect of a preservative called thimerosal. Anti-vaccine campaigners have pointed to thimerosal as the trigger for various diseases — including both autism and ADHD — even though it hasn’t been included in childhood vaccines since 2001, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All three of those studies found that there was no association between vaccination and ADHD. “Therefore, parents can be reassured that vaccines do not cause ADHD or related conditions,” the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia wrote in a post explaining the issue. Kirsch didn’t offer any support for his claims during his panel appearance, and we were unable to find any research suggesting that vaccines are responsible for any of the conditions that he listed."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"COVID-19 Booster Enhances Protection, Contrary to ‘Immune Fatigue’ Claims\". [/INST] Data show that people who have received COVID-19 booster shots — either a third dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines, or a second dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — are less likely to be infected with the coronavirus, at least temporarily, even against the now-pervasive omicron variant. Boosters also augment protection against severe disease. And there is no evidence that COVID-19 boosting can exhaust the immune system. “You don’t get immune system exhaustion from periodic boosting of the immune system,” such as with vaccines, E. John Wherry , an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told us. But Bill Maher, a comedian and talk show host known for his political satire, said otherwise in a recent interview with the entertainment website Deadline. “I mean, we’re in a very different place with Covid than we were just when I was on the air last time, and that is the vaccines, we know, do not prevent you from either transmitting it or getting the disease,” said Maher in the interview, which was published on Jan. 21 in advance of his return to his talk show “Real Time with Bill Maher.” “That’s a fact now. They just prevent you from dying, which is a great part of it, let’s not undercount that,” he continued. “But if they don’t prevent you from transmitting it and they don’t prevent you from getting it why are we still treating this disease the way we always have? And what the f*ck is the use of a booster shot? Because I will never get a booster shot.” Maher went on to call booster shots “useless” and suggested that boosters would somehow make it more difficult for your immune system to fight the virus, citing an article in the New York Times about fourth mRNA shots being given in Israel. “Now, this I read in the front page of the New York Times , which is a very pro-vaccine publication, and even they printed that many scientists in Israel were against this, scientists and doctors, because they said it might have a reverse effect, something called immune system fatigue,” he said. “Well, I don’t want that, do you? So, now you’re not protected by the vaccine or your immune system? I don’t think so.” Several conservative outlets have promoted Maher’s statements, sharing them on Facebook. Children’s Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vaccination organization, has also made similar claims about immune system fatigue or immune system overload , based on the New York Times story, and misinterpreted comments from a press briefing from the European Medicines Agency. Maher is entitled to his opinions about whether the public health strategy should change, but he has his facts wrong about boosters and the possible problems with frequent boosting. Repeated boosts in short succession may not provide much additional benefit, and there is a theoretical concern that, depending on how it is done, multiple subsequent boosters could make it harder to respond to new variants. But boosters are not expected to lead to any kind of “immune system fatigue.” Boosters are not “useless.” While it’s true that two doses of the mRNA vaccines still provide good protection against severe disease — which is why vaccinating the unvaccinated is the first priority for many public health experts — boosters give your immune system a bump."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Autopsy Study Doesn’t Show COVID-19 Vaccines Are Unsafe\". [/INST] Clinical trials, vaccine safety surveillance systems and follow-up studies have shown that the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are remarkably safe. There is a small but increased risk of inflammation of the heart muscle or surrounding tissue, known as myocarditis or pericarditis, following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly in younger males after a second dose. But the condition is rare and, in most cases, resolves quickly. Yet a study by scientists affiliated with the Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany published in Clinical Research in Cardiology in November is being cited on social media to misleadingly suggest the vaccines are unsafe. The researchers examined autopsy data from 35 people who died unexpectedly within 20 days of COVID-19 vaccination and concluded that for two of them, vaccine-induced myocarditis represented the “likely” cause of death, while for three others, the condition was a “possible” cause of death. Some experts, however, have questioned those conclusions — and even if valid, they don’t mean the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits. On the contrary, numerous studies have shown the vaccines provide good protection against severe COVID-19 and death — and only rarely cause serious side effects. Studies have also shown that in most age groups myocarditis following vaccination is less frequent than after COVID-19, and clinically, most vaccine-related myocarditis cases are mild. This context was missing when many people shared the autopsy study online. “Autopsies found that 5/35 people who died suddenly within 20 days of COVID-19 vaccination had myocarditis as a likely/possible cause of death,” Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo tweeted on Dec. 2, linking to the study. “These deaths aren’t captured by other studies because these patients never made it to the hospital…mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are far less safe than any vaccines widely used. When does sanity return to science? Why do scientists breathlessly defend this technology?” he added, in a tweet that got over 18,000 likes. Ladapo also misleadingly said that the autopsy study was “consistent with Florida’s analysis,” referring to a discredited analysis performed by the Florida Department of Health. It purportedly found an increased risk of cardiac-related death following vaccination in younger adult males and was the basis for the state to no longer recommend the mRNA vaccines for that group in October. As we wrote at the time, experts in statistics said the analysis was flawed. Last week, in a roundtable hosted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Ladapo announced a plan to study myocarditis in people who died within a few weeks of COVID-19 vaccination using autopsy results, inspired by the German report. (For more information, see SciCheck’s “ DeSantis’ Dubious COVID-19 Vaccine Claims .”) Ladapo’s tweet was followed by multiple articles , videos and social media posts suggesting the German autopsy report’s findings were alarming. The report was embraced by those who have been advancing the false narrative that the vaccines are causing widespread deaths. Its publication came just a few days after the release of “Died Suddenly,” a viral video that baselessly claimed the vaccines were causing people to suddenly drop dead in a plot to depopulate the world. “Major New Autopsy Report Reveals Those Who Died Suddenly Were Likely Killed by the Covid Vaccine,” reads a headline in the Daily Sceptic, a website known for spreading misinformation. “The fact that those who die suddenly after vaccination may have died from the hidden effects of the Covid vaccine on their heart is thus now firmly established in the medical literature,” the Daily Sceptic article continued, potentially leaving the false impression that deaths due to vaccination are widespread. According to the German study, the researchers identified “acute (epi-)myocarditis without detection of another significant disease or health constellation that may have caused an unexpected death” in four patients. But experts who reviewed the study told us there is not enough evidence to prove that the deaths were caused by the vaccine, nor can the study be used to infer how frequently vaccine-related myocarditis is fatal. “The temporal association of lymphocytic myocarditis following vaccination suggests but does not prove causality,” Dr. Leslie T. Cooper Jr., a myocarditis expert and chair of the Department of Cardiology at the Mayo Clinic in Florida, told us in an email. Cooper added that the background rate of myocarditis is around 1 to 10 in 100,000 people per year. “Because we do not know the denominator of patients vaccinated in their region during this time, we cannot calculate the expected number of cases if there were no vaccinations,” he said. “I think that it is not possible to prove that vaccination is really the cause of death of these people,” Dr. Karin Klingel , head of cardiopathology at the University Hospital Tübingen in Germany, told us in an email. Other experts who reviewed the study for Health Feedback said the same. While some social media posts claim that the study is a “major autopsy report,” the authors acknowledged that their study was “limited by the relatively small cohort size” and “does not allow any epidemiological conclusions in terms of incidence or risk estimation.” The authors also noted that they “cannot provide a definitive functional proof or a direct causal link between vaccination and myocarditis.” Co-senior author Dr. Peter Schirmacher nevertheless told FactCheck.org in an email that the study “proves the link between vaccination induced myocarditis and death” and that it’s “the largest and most diligent and structured autopsy study that exists and it covers a collective that is not addressed anywhere by adequate expert autopsy assessment.” According to the existing evidence , post-vaccine myocarditis is more frequent in males, particularly in those ages 12 to 24, after a second dose. The cases included in the German study, however, included three females, ages 50, 62 and 75; and two males, ages 46 and 55. Four of the deaths occurred after the first dose of the vaccine. Dr. Frank Han, a pediatric cardiologist at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, said on Twitter that the study establishes that the patients had myocarditis, but whether they died of an arrhythmia from myocarditis was less clear. He noted that some of the individuals “had pulmonary and vascular findings consistent with atherosclerosis and pulmonary congestion,” and based on what the authors included in the paper, “it’s unknown why they think atherosclerosis was noncontributory.” As one expert told Health Feedback, more autopsies should be done, as they may be able to identify the risk factors for adverse events following vaccination, which could make vaccination even safer. But autopsy reports such as these aren’t evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines are too risky or that many people are dying from them. Cooper, of the Mayo Clinic in Florida, pointed us to a recent publication from Hong Kong, which analyzed health records of vaccinated people, ages 12 years or older, hospitalized with myocarditis. Out of 104 patients hospitalized with myocarditis within 28 days of receiving a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, one died within six months of the diagnosis. That’s a mortality rate of about 1%, which according to Cooper, is a bit higher than what other case series have found. Even going with the 1% rate, Cooper said this would mean the risk of death from vaccine-related myocarditis would be 1 in 2 million to 1 in 10 million. A study published in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in April found that the risk for cardiac complications including myocarditis, pericarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome was “significantly higher” after an infection with the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, than after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, for both males and females in all age groups. “Even among males aged 12–17 years, the group with the highest incidence of cardiac complications after receipt of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose, the risk was 1.8–5.6 times as high after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after vaccination,” the study said."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Misleadingly Omit Critical Data Supporting COVID-19 Vaccines for Youngest Kids\". [/INST] In June, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first COVID-19 vaccines for young children: a three-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, for kids 6 months old through 4 years of age, and a two-dose Moderna vaccine, for 6 months through 5 years of age. Both vaccines, which use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to trigger a protective immune response against the coronavirus, are smaller-dosed versions of the companies’ vaccines for adults, which were found in large, randomized controlled trials to be effective. Real-world evidence also has repeatedly shown the vaccines provide strong protection against severe disease. As with the authorizations for other children, the primary way the FDA evaluated the COVID-19 vaccines for young kids for effectiveness was through a comparison of the children’s antibody responses to those of adults. If a similar percentage of vaccinated children produce antibodies — and in similar amounts — to vaccinated adults, then it can be inferred that the kids’ vaccine is also effective. This approach, known as immunobridging, is an established method that has been used for other vaccines, including those given to children. Importantly, the pediatric trials were designed as immunobridging studies from the start — and were not necessarily meant to be able to provide good efficacy estimates of how well the vaccines prevent infection or symptomatic disease. This is especially relevant because with the rise of the highly transmissible and more immune-evasive omicron variant, scientists don’t expect the vaccines to be very good at averting infections or mild illnesses. Instead, the vaccines are primarily useful in preventing severe disease. An online post critical of the shots for young children, however, misleadingly skips over all of that. Instead, it calls Pfizer’s and Moderna’s data “extremely weak” and “inconclusive” and only mentions the lackluster or uncertain efficacy estimates from the studies, which were conducted during the omicron era. “In the subgroup of children aged six months to two years, the trial found that the vaccine could result in a 99% lower chance of infection—but that they also could have a 370% increased chance of being infected,” the post said about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. “In other words, Pfizer reported a range of vaccine efficacy so wide that no conclusion could be inferred. No reputable medical journal would accept such sloppy and incomplete results with such a small sample size.” The piece, which was a July 14 guest post on former New York Times opinion columnist Bari Weiss ’ Substack page, went on to feature Moderna’s efficacy figures, which it called “very weak” or “low.” The reported efficacy numbers are correct (or nearly so — one of the Moderna figures is not the primary efficacy number). But as we said, that was not the only or even the main information regulators and outside experts used to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccines. And as a former FDA official told us, focusing on those numbers misses the point. “The critical thing in this is that even if the vaccines aren’t very effective in protecting against mild disease … that doesn’t mean they won’t be effective in protecting against severe disease,” Dr. Philip Krause , former deputy FDA chief for vaccines, said in a phone interview. “That was really the FDA’s goal in making the vaccines available.” The Substack post was co-authored by Dr. Marty Makary , a surgeon and public policy researcher at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who has previously spread misleading or unsupported information about COVID-19, and Dr. Tracy Beth Høeg , a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician in private practice in California. Høeg is also a consultant epidemiologist for the state of Florida, which is the only state to recommend not vaccinating healthy children against COVID-19. The post was subsequently shared on social media and picked up by Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, which spawned additional posts . On Twitter, Makary criticized the use of “immunobridging,” saying there was “no justification to bypass rigorous safety & efficacy clinical trials in children.” But as we’ve explained in our guide to the COVID-19 vaccines for the youngest children, the plan from the start was to use immunobridging to infer that the COVID-19 vaccines would work similarly well in children as adults. “The FDA established with the companies immunobridging criteria to show that the immune responses in these children would be at a level that would likely give comparable protection to what was observed in older people,” said Krause. “And that’s something that’s been done for many other vaccines.” Immunobridging between children and adults has been used to approve Vaxchora, a cholera vaccine, Krause said, and the method was also used to approve two HPV vaccines down to age 9. Immunobridging from a different flu vaccine tested in children also served as the basis for approving the seasonal flu vaccine Afluria in kids, he added. “Immunobridging is a common way to extend an existing vaccine into new populations,” Natalie Dean , a biostatistician at Emory University who specializes in methods evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines, told us in an email. “We leverage the extensive efficacy and safety data from other populations, and so do not need to start from scratch in generating evidence.” Dr. Paul A. Offit , a vaccine expert and pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s advisory committee, previously told us that the large confidence intervals for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s efficacy figures meant that little could be concluded from them — but that the antibody data was “excellent” and “enough” to know that the vaccine is likely to work. He confirmed to us that the data that “convinced” the FDA to authorize the COVID-19 vaccines for little kids was the immunobridging data. “Specifically, that the titer of neutralizing antibodies found after vaccination was virtually identical to those titers found in the 18-25-year-old age groups where protection against severe disease was excellent,” he said in an email."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Meme Trumpets Falsehood About Delta Variant\". [/INST] The delta variant of the coronavirus, which was first documented in India in October, is now the dominant variant in the U.S. It accounted for more than half of new infections for the two weeks ending July 3, according to the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Viruses change over time and, as they mutate, they produce variants, which can develop more dangerous attributes. Four variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been called “ notable ” by the CDC, which is monitoring their growth across the country. The delta variant is among them. This variant of the virus spreads more quickly and easily than the original, and it has been designated as a “variant of concern” by both the World Health Organization and a U.S. government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group . A variant that spreads more easily could lead to more cases of COVID-19, which could strain the health care system and, potentially, cause more deaths, according to the CDC . “Where the delta variant is identified, it really rapidly takes off and spreads between people more efficiently than even the alpha variant,” WHO epidemiologist Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained in a recent interview . So far, the delta variant has been detected in 98 countries, according to the WHO. But a meme has been circulating on Facebook suggesting that the variant isn’t real or isn’t serious. It says, “The Delta Variant Is Fake News.” That text is typed over a 2017 executive order that then-President Donald Trump signed to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership . After signing it, Trump held up the order and a photo of that moment has been used to make a host of similar memes. The meme has garnered comments indicating that many believe the mutations of the virus that causes COVID-19 are political fabrications, as shown in this example : “ They’re just getting us ready to lock us down again in 2022 so they can have a cheat fest again.” But, as we said, the delta variant is a “ variant of concern ” and is now responsible for more than half of the new COVID-19 infections in the U.S. It’s worth noting, too, that the currently available vaccines appear to be effective against the delta variant, but it’s important to get the full dosage of the vaccine if two shots are required, as is the case for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Also, the standard public health guidance that recommends physical distancing and wearing masks can help to control the spread of this variant.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Video Makes False Claim About Pride Month Flag Display\". [/INST] Many companies and institutions observe Pride Month each June to show support for the LGBTQ+ community. This year, the rainbow displays and expressions of inclusivity have met with backlash from some conservatives. Target, for example, removed merchandise from its “Pride Collection” following protests and threats from some customers, citing concern for employee safety. Even the popular Cracker Barrel restaurant chain faced a boycott for acknowledging Pride Month. Social media posts have fanned the flames by spreading misinformation about support for Pride Month. As we wrote, an artist’s animated video showing a rainbow appearing to encircle the Arc de Triomphe in Paris was making the rounds with the false claim that the rainbow was physically attached to the historic monument and “defaced” it. A June 8 Instagram post misrepresents a different Pride Month display. The text on the post says, “The United Nations replaces all 193 country flags with LGBT flags.” It received more than 115,000 likes. The post from Clarkson Lawson, who has 126,000 Instagram followers, uses a photo with that text as a backdrop of a video in which he expresses his view that celebrating Pride Month is akin to “special treatment” for the LGBTQ+ community. “Nobody in their right mind wants to be completely inundated with Pride flags for the month of June,” he says in the video. But the U.N. did not take down the flags of its member nations for Pride Month. “The only flags that fly in front of the U.N. are the 193 member states’ flags and [those of] the two observers, and the U.N. flag,” Shirin Yaseen , associate spokesperson for the U.N. secretary-general, told us in a phone interview. Those flags are always displayed and are never replaced for occasions such as Pride Month, Yaseen said. UNAIDS, the U.N. agency charged with ending the AIDS epidemic, did issue a statement affirming “solidarity” with LGBTQ+ communities. “Pride Month provides an opportunity to celebrate the resilience, diversity, and achievements” of those communities, while serving as “a reminder of the important collective commitment to human rights, equality, and the urgent need to decriminalize same-sex relationships,” the agency said. In addition, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a June 1 tweet , “Let’s celebrate the richness & diversity of the LGBTIQ+ community and honour their immense contributions to the human rights movement.” Rather than at the U.N. headquarters in New York City, the photo shown in the Instagram post was actually taken at the plaza of Rockefeller Center, possibly in 2019 . On its website, Rockefeller Center explains the celebration of Pride Month has become a “staple” at its space in Manhattan, “playing a key role in ensuring there’s an inclusive and diverse space for all in the heart of Midtown.” “Throughout the month of June, our campus will be awash in signs and symbols of Pride with rainbow pathways, hundreds of Pride flags surrounding The Rink, and vinyl decals decorating its spaces,” the center’s website says."

Loretta Sanchez said in a recent interview that California Attorney General Kamala Harris has done \"nothing\" to address a backlog of cases in a high-profile gun ownership tracking system. The database allows law enforcement to seize guns from people with criminal records and mental illness. \"So the Legislature gave the Attorney General $25 million to match up those people who were felons versus those people who were buying guns. Just a database, so that we could weed out what was going on with respect to those people who shouldn’t be able to purchase guns – by existing law. Nothing was done. I mean, $25 million was spent, butwe don’t have that database,\" Sanchez said. Not only does the program exist, but some progress has been made. The backlog has been cut from more than 20,000 cases to 12,700. That’s after Harris’ office spent $15 million of $24 million allocated by the Legislature and governor. Some continue to argue that the cases should be cleared more quickly, citing the mass shootings that have continued across the country. But there’s no denying that the Attorney General’s Office, under Harris, has put a dent in the backlog, allowing for the seizure of thousands of guns. And that’s far from \"nothing.\" While there’s room to criticize the pace of the program, Sanchez’s statement amounts to a complete misrepresentation of reality.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Magic Johnson Did Not Contract HIV from a Vaccine, Contrary to Online Claim\". [/INST] In 1991, NBA superstar Earvin “Magic” Johnson retired from the basketball league following his diagnosis earlier that year with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that can lead to AIDS. In his retirement press conference , Johnson announced he would become a public figure for those diagnosed with HIV, “because I want people, young people, to realize that they can practice safe sex.” Less than a week later, Johnson wrote in Sports Illustrated that he “was infected by having unprotected sex with a woman who has the virus.” In the over 30 years since his diagnosis, Johnson and his wife, Cookie, have repeatedly affirmed that he contracted HIV through sexual intercourse. Yet an Instagram post on Jan. 12 falsely claimed that Johnson contracted HIV through a hepatitis B vaccine program allegedly conducted by the NBA in 1991. The post has received more than 21,000 views and 3,000 likes. The 37-second video was posted by Judy Mikovits, a former chronic fatigue researcher who has claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic is a conspiracy. The video splices together highlights of her interview with Stew Peters, a conservative radio host who frequently spreads COVID-19 misinformation . In the video, Mikovits claims that the medical community “knew who was susceptible, just as they did with Magic Johnson and the NBA in 1991. They gave those men HIV, they did not give them AIDS, in a contaminated hepatitis B vaccine program. They drove an industry through the gain-of-function studies of Tony Fauci, and he knew it since 1983.” In the post’s caption, she said, “Why did Magic Johnson test positive for HIV? Because Fauci’s gain of function study used a contaminated Hepatitis B vaccine. Targeting the susceptible then & now!” The false claim that hepatitis B vaccines were once contaminated with HIV is not new. The first commercially available hepatitis B vaccine used an antigen derived from plasma from individuals with chronic hepatitis B infection, and gay men — who were also at high risk of HIV infection — were known to have donated plasma for the effort. This raised theoretical concerns that even with purification, people might contract HIV from the vaccine. But in fact, investigations showed that each of the three inactivation steps used to make the hepatitis vaccine would inactivate HIV and the vaccine did not have detectable HIV in it. Vaccine recipients also lacked any evidence of HIV infection. Today, the hepatitis B vaccine contains no blood products and is made from proteins produced in yeast. Similar to Mikovits, some people have incorrectly claimed that HIV originated in a hepatitis B vaccine trial that enrolled gay men and began in 1978, since some of the first AIDS cases were participants in the trials. But evidence contradicts that idea. Among the gay men in the trial, there was no association between when they were given a vaccine and when they developed antibodies to HIV. Also, by analyzing viral genomes, scientists have demonstrated that HIV was already circulating in the U.S. by 1971. As we said, Johnson contracted HIV through sexual intercourse, not from a hepatitis B vaccination program. In response to Mikovits’ claims, Alexia Grevious Henderson , vice president at Magic Johnson Enterprises, told the Associated Press that Johnson has never suggested that any vaccine contributed to him contracting HIV. Johnson has also noted the positive role Fauci — a former HIV researcher who recently retired from his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases — had in the basketball star’s life, helping him accept the implications of his diagnosis. We did not find any support for the claim that the NBA ran a hepatitis B vaccination program in 1991, or that any hepatitis B vaccine was a part of gain-of-function research conducted by Fauci. We have reached out to the NBA for comment on whether any such vaccination program occurred and to the National Institutes of Health on whether there was any gain-of-function research behind the development of a hepatitis B vaccine, but we did not hear back. Mikovits did not respond to a request for comment on the evidence behind her claim. This isn’t the first time Johnson’s status as an HIV-positive patient has led to viral misinformation about him. As we’ve written before, social media posts falsely claimed Johnson has donated blood for people with COVID-19. He hasn’t donated HIV-infected blood for any medical reason."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Falsely Tie Myanmar Election to Dominion Voting Systems\". [/INST] A false narrative pushed in the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election — that a voting systems company had somehow facilitated massive fraud to the detriment of former President Donald Trump — is now being recycled to suggest a similar tale in Myanmar. But that insinuation is also bunk. The Southeast Asian nation does not use Dominion Voting Systems, contrary to claims on social media. The erroneous claim surfaced online Feb. 1, following news that Myanmar’s military had staged a coup and detained the country’s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and other members of her party. The military, which is closely aligned with the country’s major opposition party, announced that it would impose a state of emergency for a year. Suu Kyi’s party handily won the election in November, but the military has claimed that widespread irregularities could have led to fraud — despite a national election commission saying there is no evidence to back up that allegation — as the Associated Press reported . On Twitter and Facebook , some users suggested the Myanmar military’s election fraud claim is somehow related to Dominion. “The White House is freaking out after Myanmar Military arrests political leaders for Election Fraud in their November 8 elections. Myanmar used Dominion Voting Systems,” a Facebook post reads. The post included a 2012 photo of former President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meeting with Suu Kyi. A spokesperson for Dominion told us in a statement that “ Dominion had absolutely no involvement whatsoever in Myanmar in any capacity.” “Neither Dominion’s machines nor its software had any role in Myanmar’s elections or the ongoing political unrest there,” the spokesperson added. Allegations of election fraud lodged against Dominion in the U.S. have been repeatedly debunked , including by audits of the underlying paper ballots. Some organizations that provided a platform to baseless claims about the company have since distanced themselves from those claims or apologized , following threats of legal action by the company. There is also no evidence that Myanmar used technology from Smartmatic, another election systems company that was the focus of baseless allegations about vote switching, as we’ve reported . One viral tweet claimed “Myanmar’s Nov election: Used Dominion & Smartmatic” — and seemed to suggest the U.S. should have taken steps similar to Myanmar’s coup. But there is no indication that Myanmar even used voting machines for its election. A report by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance on Myanmar’s 2020 election makes no mention of any voting machines — let alone Dominion or Smartmatic systems — being used. Nor does a report outlining observations from the election by the Myanmar-based People’s Alliance for Credible Elections. The former report, on page 21, outlines a process by which a voter “marks the candidate” with a “voting stamp,” then folds the ballot and inserts it into a ballot box. It makes no references to machines being used to count votes. Tun Myint , an associate professor of political science at Carleton College in Minnesota, likewise told us in a phone interview that he was not aware of machines being used in the elections. Myint is a native of Myanmar (also known as Burma) whose studies focus on the country and on Southeast Asia. Myint described the process like the one outlined in the reports, pointing out that news photos of the military leader, Min Aung Hlaing, voting in the November election show him casting his paper ballot into a ballot box. “The infrastructure is not there,” he said, of villages and towns using machines to facilitate elections.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Conservative Politicians, Commentators Recirculate Old Falsehood on Aid for Immigrants\". [/INST] Social media has been awash with claims inflating the amount of government aid given to immigrants as crossings at the southern border continue to draw attention . Vivek Ramaswamy, a candidate for the Republican nomination for president, for example, posted one such meme on Oct. 2. It said: “Retirement plan: 1) Move to Mexico 2) Give up citizenship 3) Come back illegally 4) Set for life!” The same claim has been circulating since September, racking up tens of thousands of engagements, after Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado wrote on X , “Biden is giving each illegal family $2,200 per month plus a free plane ticket and free medical care. If you come to this country illegally, you get everything handed to you on a silver platter. If you’re a struggling American citizen, you get nothing.” We emailed Boebert’s campaign to ask what her claim was based on, but we didn’t get a response. Our email to her congressional office asking the same thing wasn’t answered, either. So, we don’t know where she got her faulty information. But there had been a story on the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website known for spreading false claims , that made a similar claim on Sept. 7, the day before Boebert posted on social media. The headline on that story said: “Outrageous! Border Patrol Agent Reveals Biden Regime Gives $2,200 of Taxpayer Money Per Illegal Immigrant Family, Plus a Plane Ticket, Housing, Food, Free Medical Services.” But the only support for that claim in the story came from a video posted on X on Sept. 6 purporting to show an anonymous border patrol agent. As the camera panned around a group of people who appeared to be immigrant parents with children, the border agent said, “They get a check every month. … My understanding, I’ve heard it’s around $2,200.” About two weeks before that video was posted, retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor had claimed on Tucker Carlson’s show , hosted on X: “We hand every alleged asylum seeker – illegal migrant – pouring into the border in Texas or wherever else, we hand them when they get there $2,200 and we put them on that $2,200 diet from there on out per month.” We reached out to Macgregor, a frequent guest on conservative broadcasts, to ask where he got his information about the monthly payments. His office told us it came from a July 24 post on X , the platform formerly known as Twitter, from a group called Texans for Strong Borders . That post repeated, almost verbatim, a widely debunked claim that conservative commentator Charlie Kirk made on Twitter in 2019 about refugees — not people living in the U.S. illegally. Both posts claimed: “The government pays out $2,125/month in refugee benefits to refugees resettled in the United States.” We asked Texans for Strong Borders why it posted this debunked claim four years after it was first made, but we didn’t hear back. Misinformation is often recycled in this way and this claim, in particular, is a perfect example. It started as a falsehood about refugee assistance in Canada in 2004 and later migrated to the U.S. We wrote about versions of this claim, beginning in 2007 , and then again in 2009 , 2010 , and 2019 . PolitiFact wrote about another version of the claim in 2018 , when a Facebook post wrongly said “illegal refugees get $3,874/mo.” The fact-checking site pointed out that authorized refugees are eligible to receive a one-time grant worth a total of $2,125. Kirk saw that and included the figure in his 2019 post, a spokesman for Kirk told PolitiFact after his tweet had resurfaced and was widely repeated in 2021. Importantly, Kirk had misrepresented the one-time grant as a monthly payment. Now, time and repetition have flattened that initial misrepresentation of a fact into a complete falsehood by conflating aid to authorized refugees with limited assistance given to migrants who entered the country illegally. The bottom line is, U.S. law prohibits immigrants who came to the U.S. without authorization from accessing most federal benefits. There are some narrow exceptions , including emergency medical treatment; immunization against communicable diseases; short-term, non-cash disaster relief; and some services such as soup kitchens, crisis counseling and intervention, and short-term shelter. Those who have sought asylum in the U.S. and have been granted refugee status after applying through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program , on the other hand, have access to some aid. U.S. law defines a refugee , in part, as someone who is “unable or unwilling” to return to their country  “because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” The number of refugees who are accepted each year is capped by the president under the Refugee Act of 1980 — for fiscal year 2023 , the cap is set at 125,000 — so the number of people eligible for benefits is limited. As of the end of August, with one month of the fiscal year left, the U.S. had admitted a total of 51,231 refugees, according to State Department data. Those benefits include a one-time payment from the Department of State to help refugees resettle, which is now $2,375 per refugee. Only $1,275 is available to be given directly to refugees, though, to cover things such as food, clothing and rent. The rest goes to the resettlement agency, which provides services and case management for refugees during their first three months in the U.S. Other assistance programs that refugees are eligible for are time-limited, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF , and Refugee Cash Assistance, or RCA. TANF is a state-administered program for needy families that is funded jointly by federal and state governments. It is available to refugee families for their first five years in the U.S. According to the most recent data available from the Department of Health and Human Services, as of fiscal year 2021, 93% of TANF recipients were U.S. citizens, while 7% were immigrants living in the U.S. legally. Families receiving TANF benefits that year got, on average, $517 per month. RCA is a federally funded program that is also administered by states. Cash benefit levels are set by each state, so the amounts vary . That program, which is available to refugees who don’t qualify for TANF, covers only the first eight months that a refugee is in the country. So, the claim from Ramaswamy and the others suggesting that anyone who enters the U.S. without authorization is entitled to more benefits than citizens is wrong. Those immigrants have very limited access to the country’s social safety net programs . Ramaswamy didn’t respond to our questions about his claim."

[/INST] School-entry vaccination requirements are set by state or local officials, not the CDC or the federal government. Numerous social media posts, however, claimed otherwise in advance of a two-day CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting starting on Oct. 19. “The CDC is about to add the Covid vaccine to the childhood immunization schedule, which would make the vax mandatory for kids to attend school,” tweeted Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Oct. 18, sharing a clip of his show from that evening, which had also discussed the topic. The false claim soon went viral. Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly said in an Oct. 19 tweet , for example, “HOW DARE THE CDC ADD THIS TO ITS LIST OF SCHOOL VACCINATIONS?” The CDC doesn’t have a list of school-required vaccines. “States hold the reins on school vaccination requirements,” Lindsay Wiley , a law professor and faculty director of the health law and policy program at UCLA School of Law, told us in an email. The process for adding a vaccine to school requirements varies by state, she said, but typically involves the state health or education departments, sometimes working together, who are given that authority from the state legislature. In some states, she added, local districts also have the ability to add a school-required vaccine. The furor appears to have been sparked by Dr. Nicole Saphier, a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center radiologist and Fox News contributor , who wrote in an Oct. 18 tweet , “Tomorrow, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will vote on adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the schedule of childhood vaccines required of students in order to attend school.” In reality, the CDC committee was voting the following day on whether to add COVID-19 vaccines to the Vaccines For Children program, which has nothing to do with school vaccination requirements. The program provides free vaccines to under-insured or uninsured kids, which would become relevant when the COVID-19 vaccines enter the commercial market and the government no longer provides them at no cost to the public. The day after that, the panel was voting on a variety of changes to the pediatric immunization schedules, including the addition of the COVID-19 vaccines. While a listing on the CDC’s immunization schedule is necessary in some states for a vaccine to be required for school, and might encourage states to choose to require them, the listing itself does not automatically make a vaccine required. The schedule , which is reviewed each year by the CDC advisory committee, is primarily meant to inform pediatricians about which vaccines are recommended and when they should be given. More than nine hours after her initial tweet, Saphier clarified on Twitter that the CDC would be voting on updating the immunization schedule, which “often gets incorporated into public school vaccine requirements but varies by state.” But she did not remove her earlier, erroneous tweet. On Oct. 19, the CDC attempted to correct Carlson on Twitter by sharing a link about state vaccination requirements and stating, “States establish vaccine requirements for school children, not ACIP or CDC.” But that evening, Carlson doubled down on his false claim, accusing the CDC of “lying.” He said during a segment on his show, “More than a dozen states follow the CDC’s immunization schedule to set vaccination requirements — not suggestions, requirements — for children to be educated.” He cited as examples Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, New Jersey, Vermont and Ohio, and included select statements from some of the state department of health websites. But none of those states automatically add vaccines listed on the CDC childhood immunization schedule to their school immunization requirements. In fact, none currently requires all of the vaccines that are listed on the schedule. “Carlson is misreading the statutes and regulations he cites and quoting language out of context,” Wiley said, noting that his researchers might have confused references about following the CDC’s dosing schedule for state-required vaccines, which is different from requiring all of the CDC’s listed vaccines. Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said in a statement to FactCheck.org: “The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine to be added to the formulary or schedule of vaccines for children does not mandate this vaccine for school children.” Instead, “Ohio law determines required vaccines for school attendance,” Vanderhoff said, pointing to the Ohio Revised Code on proof of required immunizations . “The state’s list of required vaccines can only be changed through legislation.” “Under Vermont law, the vaccine schedule for school attendance is adopted by regulation,” Katie Warchut, public health communication officer for the Vermont Department of Health, explained in an email, referring us to that state’s statute . “The Department of Health convenes an advisory committee that takes into account ACIP’s recommendations but is not bound by them.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Bogus Tweet Spreads False Account of ‘First American Casualty’ in Ukraine\". [/INST] On Feb. 23, a bogus tweet from an account masquerading as CNN falsely announced the “first American casualty of the Ukraine crisis.” The tweet — from the unverified, now suspended account @CNNUKR — said, in part: “Thoughts and prayers with the family of activist Bernie Gores who passed away this morning after a mine planted by Russian backed separatists exploded.” It was similar to another bogus CNN tweet posted in August when the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. In that case, the unverified, since suspended account @CNNAfghan said in an Aug. 16, 2021, tweet: “#CNN Journalist ‘Bernie Gores’ executed in #Kabul by #Taliban soldiers.” In both cases, the tweets included an image of the same smiling man. It didn’t take long before Facebook posts began to circulate showing the tweets side by side, along with allegations that CNN is lying and an “enemy of the people.” “See how CNN Blantantly LIES to the public!!” one Facebook post said . “The LEFT post is from August 2021 – the RIGHT post is from February 2022 – Using the man as a fatlity 2x !! Lmao The media in this country is a frikkin JOKE the world laughs at us! PAY ATTENTION!!!!!” Another post said , “Wow!! The same person that was “executed” by the Taliban in Afghanistan-Is also the FiRST American casualty in the “Ukraine Crisis.” See how that works? CNN is the enemy of the people. Why lie? Go ahead and look at ALL the fact check sites saying these tweets never came from CNN, I found the original tweets FROM CNN and captured them.” But the original tweets are not from CNN and the photo is not “Bernie Gores.” The tweets, as we said, were from unverified accounts that have been suspended by Twitter. Reuters wrote in August that CNN confirmed that the first tweet was false. Matt Dornic, a CNN spokesperson, told Reuters at the time: “This is a fabricated story and a fake post.” Reuters also found that the image in the August tweet is actually YouTube gamer and podcaster Jordie Jordan . The Feb. 23 tweet featured the same photo, and we used a reverse image search tool called TinEye to confirm that it is Jordan — not anyone named “Gores.” The photo of Jordan used in the tweets can be found on Wikitubia , a Wikipedia-type page for YouTubers, and predates the tweets about the death of “Gores” by many months. That same image of Jordan circulated on Instagram after the Aug. 4, 2020, explosion in Beirut that killed more than 200 people. In that case, the Instagram user suggested it was a photo of “Bernie Gores in Beirut at time of explosion.” A Twitter user identified Jordan , known by video gamers as WingsOfRedemption, in an Aug. 5, 2020, tweet that included the hashtag #trolls. We also found that the @CNNUKR account used in the most recent incident was created this month and had just 129 followers. Twitter suspended the account sometime after the bogus Feb. 23 tweet. The real CNN has numerous Twitter accounts — including @cnni , or CNN International, which has 13.3 million followers. That account, which CNN created in 2007, is verified by Twitter as an authentic CNN account. Twitter gives verified accounts a blue check mark.

[/INST] The risk of cardiac complications is significantly higher after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, than after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, for both males and females in all age groups, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A large study published this year in Nature Medicine found that COVID-19 increased the risk for several heart disorders, including heart attacks, arrhythmias, strokes, cardiac arrests and myocarditis. Myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, have been identified as r are side effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in young males after a second dose. But the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks for males and females in all age groups. Some news articles, widely shared online, have highlighted a disputed study that claimed to find an increase in emergency medical services calls for cardiac events in younger people when the COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out in Israel. A few of these stories misinterpreted those findings to incorrectly state that the study found that vaccines caused a rise in EMS calls. But the study, which multiple scientists have said has numerous flaws, only notes the correlation. “New Peer-Reviewed Study: COVID-19 Vaccines Increase Risk of Cardiac Arrest in Young People by 25 Percent,” reads an inaccurate headline of a story published on May 4 in the Epoch Times. The study, published on April 28, looked at rates of emergency medical calls for cardiac arrest and acute coronary syndrome in people ages 16 to 39 in Israel during the pandemic. The authors, affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management and the marketing and international relations division of the Israeli national EMS organization Magen David Adom, found a 25% increase in calls for both cardiovascular events during the vaccination campaign. Although the authors do not establish a causal relationship between the increase in calls and the vaccines, they say the calls “were significantly associated with the rates of 1st and 2nd vaccine doses administered to this age group but were not with COVID-19 infection rates.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"No Change in George Floyd’s Cause of Death, Despite Viral False Claims\". [/INST] George Floyd, a Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on Floyd’s neck during an arrest in Minneapolis for about nine minutes while Floyd said repeatedly that he couldn’t breathe. The incident sparked protests and riots across the country. Chauvin was subsequently convicted of murdering Floyd. The county medical examiner who conducted the autopsy listed Floyd’s death as a homicide and determined that the cause was “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.” This finding was highlighted in the first set of charges leveled against Chauvin in May 2020 and was explained in detail by the medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, during Chauvin’s trial. “The top line of the cause of death is really what you think is the most important thing that precipitated the death. Other things that you think played a role in the death but were not direct causes get relegated to what’s known as the ‘other significant conditions’ part of the death certificate,” Baker said at the trial , explaining why Floyd’s other health conditions weren’t included in his cause of death. “So, the other significant conditions are things that played a role in the death, but didn’t directly cause the death,” Baker said. “So, for example, Mr. Floyd’s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint; his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint.” Nothing new has emerged in the medical examiner’s findings. But recently posts have been circulating on social media falsely claiming that new court documents show Floyd was not murdered and, instead, died of a drug overdose. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson also posted a video to his X account on Oct. 20 in which he says, “George Floyd, according to the official autopsy, was not murdered. He died instead of what we used to call natural causes, which in his case would include decades of drug use, as well as the fatal concentration of fentanyl that was in his system on his final day.” That’s not true. Floyd’s autopsy report hasn’t changed. It shows Floyd had fentanyl in his system when he died, but determined his death was caused by action taken by police that resulted in cardiac arrest. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s office confirmed to us in a phone interview on Nov. 3 that no changes have been made. Experts at Chauvin’s trial also said the evidence doesn’t support the idea that he had died of an overdose, as USA Today reported . Misinformation pushers have been making claims similar to Carlson’s since a website highlighted statements that were recently made public in an unrelated court case. The website, called Alpha News, describes itself as an outlet focusing on Minnesota news that “mainstream media all too often refuses to report and routinely disregards.” It doesn’t disclose any kind of political affiliation, but the site was founded by Alex Kharam, who is the executive director of a nonprofit that “works to promote conservative ideals and free market principles.” The nonprofit had an associated political action committee that spent more than $250,000 since the 2016 election cycle to support conservative politicians in Minnesota, according to data from the Federal Election Commission. The person who wrote the story with the highlighted quotes, Liz Collin, published a book in October 2022 titled, “They’re Lying: The Media, The Left, and The Death of George Floyd.” In her Oct. 17 story, Collin cited depositions that were made public in a sex discrimination lawsuit that a former prosecutor had brought against the Hennepin County attorney who was in office at the time of Floyd’s death. The suit isn’t related to Chauvin’s case. But the prosecutor, Amy Sweasy, had worked on charging Chauvin early on, and some incidents in the county attorney’s office at the time came up in her deposition . Sweasy was clear in her deposition that she agreed with the decision to charge Chauvin in the death of Floyd, although she disagreed with the degree to which he should be charged and she did not support the decision to charge the other three officers who had assisted in Floyd’s arrest. Two of those officers have since pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter, and the third was found guilty on the same charge in a bench trial. In her letter resigning from the case in early June 2020, Sweasy wrote: “When I wrote and signed the complaint against Derek Chauvin, I believed in the charges and that there was sufficient admissible evidence to prove the elements of those crimes beyond reasonable doubt at trial; I still do. Unfortunately, the decision to add additional charges against former Officer Chauvin and to bring charges against the other involved officers is, in my opinion, clearly contrary to Rule 3.8(a). For this reason, I have resigned from this case and will have no further part of it. “What I am unable to do right now is prosecute three men for failing to act and speak up when they saw something going horribly wrong and then do the same by failing to speak up myself. Thank you.” Sweasy’s original complaint had charged Chauvin with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The final complaint added a third charge of second-degree murder under a subdivision of the law that covers “unintentional murders.” A jury later found Chauvin guilty on all three charges. None of this was included in Collin’s story. Instead, that story quoted from a section of the deposition in which Sweasy recounted a phone conversation she said she had with the medical examiner on the day he performed Floyd’s autopsy. As Sweasy recalled in the deposition , “he told me that there were no medical findings that showed any injury to the vital structures of Mr. Floyd’s neck. There were no medical indications of asphyxia or strangulation. He said to me, ‘Amy, what happens when the actual evidence doesn’t match up with the public narrative that everyone’s already decided on?’ And then he said, ‘This is the kind of case that ends careers.'” The issue of Floyd’s manner of death was not the subject of the deposition. Rather, lawyers were focused on who had mentioned the phrase about ending careers, since Sweasy is alleging that her former boss had threatened her career and failed to promote her. So, there was no further context or explanation in the deposition about Baker’s alleged statement to Sweasy. As we explained, when he completed the final autopsy report, the medical examiner had determined that Floyd died of cardiac arrest due to the neck restraint carried out by police. He did not determine that Floyd died of asphyxia or strangulation, so there’s nothing new that has been revealed. We reached out to Sweasy for further explanation, but, through her lawyers, she declined to comment. “Unfortunately, because the lawsuit is still pending, we cannot comment or explain testimony given,” her lawyer, Sonia Miller-Van Oort, told us in an email. “She may be able to provide clarifications to your questions in the future when the case is concluded.” The county medical examiner’s office referred us to the county spokeswoman, Carolyn Marinan, when we asked about Sweasy’s statement. “Dr. Baker cannot comment on statements made by other people in their depositions. He stands by the autopsy report and his televised testimony,” Marinan said. All that the deposition shows is that there was internal strife within the prosecutor’s office and disagreement about which charges to level against Chauvin, not whether he should be charged. And nothing at all has changed about the medical findings regarding Floyd’s cause of death. Clarification, May 29: We updated this story to clarify that Chauvin was charged with second-degree murder under a subdivision of the state statute that covers “unintentional murders.”"

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Experts: No Link Between COVID-19 Vaccines and Erectile Dysfunction\". [/INST] Contrary to what rapper Nicki Minaj claimed in a viral tweet on Sept. 13, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause erectile dysfunction, or ED. But there is some preliminary research that suggests COVID-19 itself may be associated with ED. We’ll explain more on that below. Minaj’s tweet was one of several following her announcement that she wouldn’t attend the annual Met Gala due to the COVID-19 vaccine requirements for the event. Although Minaj expressed hesitancy about getting vaccinated in her tweets, she also said that she would likely get a vaccine before going on her next tour. The tweet that went viral was vague, saying: “My cousin in Trinidad won’t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it & became impotent. His testicles became swollen.” But it garnered more than 110,000 likes and praise from conservative commentators who have sown doubt about the vaccines, such as Candace Owens and Fox News host Tucker Carlson . Although Minaj didn’t specify which vaccine her cousin’s friend supposedly got or why she thought his condition was related, medical experts and public health authorities from around the world have said the claim that the vaccines could cause ED is false. The health minister for Trinidad and Tobago, Terrence Deyalsingh , responded to the claim at a press conference on Sept. 15, saying, “As far as we know, at this point in time, there has been no such reported either side effect or adverse event. And what was sad about this is that it wasted our time yesterday trying to track down because we take all these claims seriously, whether it’s on social media or mainstream media.” Dr. Sandro Demaio , who leads the health promotion foundation for the Australian state of Victoria, took to Twitter on Sept. 13 to say, “ The covid vaccines DO NOT cause erectile disfunction or male infertility.” A Welsh public health site published a straight-forward post debunking the same claim in July, saying : “There have been no reports of impotence linked to vaccination and vaccination is recommended as a protection against this side-effect of Covid infection.” In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that those who are trying to have a baby — both male and female — get vaccinated against COVID-19. And Dr. Y. Sammy Choi , director of the department of research at Fort Bragg’s Womack Army Medical Center, said on a recent podcast , “There is no evidence that any of the vaccines leads to erectile dysfunction, sterility, infertility, in man or woman.” Also, CNN host Jake Tapper asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a Sept. 14 interview to address Minaj’s post: “Is there any evidence that the Pfizer or the Moderna or the J&J vaccines cause any reproductive issues in men or women?” “The answer to that, Jake, is a resounding no. There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen,” Fauci said , adding that “the only way we know to counter mis- and disinformation is to provide a lot of correct information and to essentially debunk these kinds of claims which, you know, may be innocent on her part.” So, as we said, experts agree there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines cause ED. But there is some preliminary evidence of a possible association between the disease COVID-19 and ED from two studies, though the authors stressed more research is needed. A paper published in the journal Andrology in March found that the prevalence of ED was “significantly higher” in men who had tested positive for COVID-19. The study, which was done in Italy, included 25 men who had tested positive for COVID-19 and 75 men who had tested negative. The authors called for “more adequately tailored studies,” calling their study the first to investigate “the prevalence of ED and the possible association between ED and COVID-19 from real-life data in a large survey.” And a much smaller pilot study done in the U.S. that involved two patients who had tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently suffered from ED suggested that the disease “affects the penis,” according to Dr. Ranjith Ramasamy , director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine who worked on the study and wrote about it on the news website The Conversation. The study, the authors claimed, is “the first to demonstrate the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the penis long after the initial infection in humans.” “[T]he research is only a first step on how COVID-19 might affect male sexual health; the samples were small,” Ramasamy wrote. “Studies should continue.” Editor’s note: SciCheck’s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"CDC Data Thus Far Show COVID-19 Vaccination Safe During Pregnancy\". [/INST] There is no evidence that the authorized COVID-19 vaccines pose a risk to pregnant people and their fetuses. Although pregnant people were not actively included in the clinical trials conducted prior to authorization, subsequent information about those who became pregnant during the trials and safety surveillance data following the vaccines’ rollouts thus far have indicated the immunizations are safe. Multiple online posts, however, falsely claim that CDC data reported in a New England Journal of Medicine article published in April show that the vaccines are dangerous and trigger miscarriages. “New England Journal of Medicine finds that women who got v4x3d – within 30 days of becoming pregnant and up to 20 weeks pregnant – had a miscarriage rate of 82%,” reads one Instagram post that garnered more than 5,000 likes in a day, using a shorthand for vaccination designed to avoid detection by fact-checkers. A headline on Rumble, a Canadian video sharing site, also touts the false statistic, “FACT: 82% of Pregnant Women in Study Had Miscarriage.” Two Facebook posts and an article on a dubious website similarly highlight the incorrect figure, with one claiming that the information was “deceptively buried” in a footnote in the scientific publication. The 82% miscarriage number, which does not appear in the study, is incorrect because it is based only on people who were vaccinated in their first or second trimesters and reported completing their pregnancies in the follow-up interviews conducted by March 30. The vast majority of women who had received the vaccines that early in pregnancy could not have ended their pregnancies by the time of follow-up unless they miscarried, thereby guaranteeing a very high number from such a calculation. “This is pure number manipulation and propaganda,” Eve C. Feinberg , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, told us. The figure also fails a basic sniff test. If 82% of pregnant people were actually miscarrying after being vaccinated, it would be very obvious that there were problems with the vaccines. “[T]his is a ridiculous claim and simply not observed clinically,” Feinberg said. The New England Journal of Medicine article from which the faulty percentage is derived reported on the preliminary findings of the government’s two primary vaccine safety monitoring systems — v-safe , a smartphone-based health checker run by the CDC, and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System — for pregnant people who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. It concluded there were no “obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines,” while acknowledging that additional follow-up of pregnant women, especially those vaccinated early in pregnancy, was needed. The incorrect miscarriage calculation stems from a misinterpretation of the v-safe data, which included 3,958 people enrolled in the v-safe pregnancy registry who had been vaccinated with a first dose prior to Feb. 28. CDC researchers contacted these individuals for information about their pregnancies, and from interviews performed as of March 30, 827 people had completed them, either through birth, pregnancy loss or induced abortion. Of these completed pregnancies, 104, or 12.6%, had experienced a “spontaneous abortion,” also known as a miscarriage, before 20 weeks.  Online posts, however, have latched onto a footnote in table 4 that says 700 of the 827 participants “received their first eligible dose in the third trimester.” Because these participants couldn’t have miscarried before 20 weeks, the posts argue, the 700 people should be subtracted from the 827, making the calculation 104 miscarriages out of 127 pregnancies, or 82%. “Don’t tell me you did the math until you took out the 700 people out who got their first dose in the 3rd trimester,” the one Instagram post, now removed , reads . Experts, however, say that doing the math that way is incorrect. “[T]he quoted rate of [82%] is not the miscarriage rate,” Viki Male , a lecturer in reproductive immunology at Imperial College London, said on Twitter . “It just tells us that we can’t go from the first trimester to giving birth to a healthy baby in three months.” “[T]his is a bit of a meaningless statistic, since the only way you can complete your pregnancy within 3 months, starting in the first trimester, is to miscarry,” she added. “And presumably the only reason that rate isn’t 100% is because some people vaccinated at the end of the 2nd trimester completed their pregnancies within 3 months by giving birth.” In a statement to FactCheck.org, the CDC also said such percentages are erroneous. “This is not an appropriate calculation based on the data available because more than a 1000 pregnancies were ongoing and outcome data was not available at the time of the report,” the agency said, adding that it “will continue to study the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnancies and closely monitor any safety concerns.” Update, Nov. 8: When we first wrote about this claim, the CDC had presented its 12.6% spontaneous abortion figure, based on 104 miscarriages out of 827 completed pregnancies, in table 4 along with a “published incidence,” or normally expected rate, of 10% to 26%. The agency has since acknowledged that it shouldn’t have tried to calculate a risk estimate since it lacked follow-up data for the vast majority of women vaccinated early in their pregnancies, and corrected its paper on Oct. 14. Given the correction, we removed a paragraph from our original story citing the 12.6% figure. A footnote for table 4 now reads: “No denominator was available to calculate a risk estimate for spontaneous abortions, because at the time of this report, follow-up through 20 weeks was not yet available for 905 of the 1224 participants vaccinated within 30 days before the first day of the last menstrual period or in the first trimester. Furthermore, any risk estimate would need to account for gestational week–specific risk of spontaneous abortion.” However, this doesn’t lend any credence to the 82% figure, which is still an incorrect calculation — and is still circulating online in newer social media posts highlighting the CDC’s correction. Other data provided in the paper allow for a different calculation that avoids the problem of including participants who were vaccinated after 20 weeks, although it has limitations. “[T]he real way to calculate this is to look at all patients who received the vaccine, not just the patients who completed pregnancy,” Northwestern’s Feinberg said. Data in the paper show that a total of 1,224 people were vaccinated around the time of conception or in the first trimester, so 104 miscarriages out of this total is a miscarriage frequency of 8.5%, she said. And correctly limiting it to just the 96 participants who had a first trimester loss to match the denominator drops the percentage to 7.8%. Feinberg said she didn’t know why the CDC didn’t report this frequency instead. Martha Sharan, a CDC spokesperson, told FactCheck.org that doing the calculation as suggested by Feinberg makes some sense, but would be an underestimate because it’s not known for certain that all the other women didn’t miscarry. “We don’t know what happened to them. We only know what happened to the 827. That’s why they decided to use the 827, because there were definite outcomes,” she said, adding that the research team would be publishing a new report with longer follow-up soon. In an email to the fact-checking site Lead Stories , Sharan explained that the agency struggled with how to best report the data, given that so many participants were still pregnant or had not yet reported an outcome to the registry. “We felt it was important to report all spontaneous abortions that had been observed in the registry thus far. At the same time, we also wanted to limit the analysis to pregnancies for which [we] had final outcome data as there may be completed pregnancies we are not yet aware of because they have not had a scheduled follow-up call,” she said. “In a future report in which more follow-up time has passed, we plan to limit the assessment of spontaneous abortions to completed pregnancies vaccinated at less than 20 weeks and whose estimated date of delivery has passed,” Sharan added. “Because of where we were in the vaccination efforts at the time of data analysis, that method provided both a numerator and denominator of zero. We therefore chose to report spontaneous abortions among all completed pregnancies in this preliminary report.” In her Twitter thread, Male said that both the CDC method and the way Feinberg recommended for calculating the proportion of miscarriages are imperfect. “[G]iven this, I can see why the authors went with reporting the conservative (ie. higher) rate,” she said . “But no matter how we calculate it, it’s still not more than that normal rate.” The New England Journal of Medicine article was upfront about the fact that the data on miscarriage were limited. “Whereas some pregnancies with vaccination in the first and early second trimester have been completed, the majority are ongoing, and a direct comparison of outcomes on the basis of timing of vaccination is needed to define the proportion of spontaneous abortions in this cohort,” the paper reads . But with the data that exist, there is no sign that the two mRNA vaccines increase the risk of a miscarriage, which is relatively common , especially in early pregnancy. “[A]s more patients deliver, the true denominator will become apparent,” Feinberg said. “The data will speak for itself, vaccination is safe in pregnant patients.” Update, Aug. 16: The CDC issued a statement on Aug. 11 recommending that pregnant people be vaccinated, based on a new analysis of v-safe pregnancy registry data that included nearly 2,500 pregnant people who received at least one dose of an mRNA vaccine before 20 weeks of gestation. That study , not yet peer-reviewed or published, found no increased risk of miscarriage with vaccination. It calculated the cumulative risk of a spontaneous abortion between six and 19 weeks — otherwise known as a miscarriage — to be 12.8% when adjusted for age, which is within the expected range. “The increased circulation of the highly contagious Delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever,” the CDC said in its statement. Update, Nov. 8: The study finding a 12.8% risk has since been published as a peer-reviewed letter to the New England Journal of Medicine on Sept. 8. Other research also supports those findings. Using data on 105,446 pregnancies from eight health systems that participate with the CDC in the Vaccine Safety Datalink program, another group of researchers found that those who experienced a miscarriage “did not have an increased odds of exposure to a COVID-19 vaccination in the prior 28 days compared with ongoing pregnancies.” Those findings were published in September in a research letter to JAMA . As we’ve written before , in contrast to evidence that COVID-19 can increase pregnancy complications, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous to pregnant people. Even though pregnant people were excluded from the vaccine clinical trials, some individuals did become pregnant while participating — and those receiving the immunizations did not miscarry more frequently. Moreover, reproductive toxicity studies of the vaccines in pregnant animals revealed no safety concerns , and as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has pointed out , based on how the vaccines work, there is no reason to think they would be any less safe for pregnant people compared to those who are not. A report published in the journal F&S on June 2 also found no difference, based on vaccination status, in the ability of an embryo to implant or to remain viable in early pregnancy among women who were undergoing in vitro fertilization to become pregnant. The results further support the idea that the vaccines are safe for pregnant people and do not have harmful effects on fertility, an unsubstantiated claim we have previously addressed . Similarly, a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on July 12 found that immunization with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel was associated with protection against infection with the coronavirus among pregnant women, with no difference in the frequency of induced or spontaneous abortions or other negative birth outcomes in those who were vaccinated compared to matched unvaccinated controls.

[/INST] The U.S. Women’s National Team , or USWNT, played their final soccer match before the Olympics on July 5 in East Hartford, Connecticut. They won the match against Mexico 4-0. But misrepresentations of their conduct before the game garnered unwarranted criticism on social media. Prior to the game, World War II veteran Pete DuPré played the U.S. national anthem on his harmonica. Some organizations and individuals on social media took issue with how the players stood during the performance. A Facebook page called Hold the Line posted an ESPN video of the national anthem alongside the caption , “WHAT A DISGRACE TO AMERICA! Members of the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team turned their backs on Pete DuPré (a 98-year-old World War II veteran) while he played the National Anthem on his harmonica. Who agrees we need to keep the woke OUT of the Olympics??? #HoldTheLine.” Hold the Line was founded by missionary and musician Sean Feucht, who describes it as a “political activist movement seeking to rally the global church to engage in their civic duty — to vote and stand up for causes of righteousness and justice in the governmental arena.” Individuals on both Facebook and Twitter posted similar assertions, calling the team’s alleged behavior “shameful,” “disrespectful” and a “new low,” with some comments calling for players to be removed from the team or have the whole team “disqualified.” But these posts mischaracterized what the players were doing. Instead of turning their backs on DuPré, some team members had turned to face the American flag at the end of the field, which is in alignment with the national anthem etiquette recommended for non-military individuals by U.S. law . United States Code 36 U.S.C. § 301 reads: “Persons present should face the flag and stand at attention with their right hand over the heart. … When the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed.” The flag is visible next to the scoreboard in other videos from the game, and a different video of the national anthem performance shows the players turning back around to clap for DuPré after he finished playing. The U.S. Soccer communications team also responded to the social media claims, writing on Twitter that “no one turned their back on WWII Veteran Pete DuPré during tonight’s anthem. Some USWNT players were simply looking at the flag on a pole in one end of the stadium. The players all love Pete, thanked him individually after the game and signed a ball for him.” In other videos posted to the USWNT Twitter feed, team members are shown shaking DuPré’s hand as they arrived and thanking and signing a soccer ball for him as they left.

One strategy was to invest in companies that played off the trend in outsourcing. We make no judgment on whether outsourcing is good or bad. It was widely seen as profitable, and Bain selected companies that would succeed. If picking a company makes it yours, then these were Romney’s companies and in a general sense, they did what he expected them to do. The one caveat is there is a gray area of direct accountability, because no one has reported that he was personally involved in managing those firms. The Obama campaign took the word from the Washington Post but used it as its own. Outsourcing was well established by the early 1990s, and firms were applying it in a variety of industrial areas.

[/INST] On Feb. 14, President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration for Texas following the start of a severe winter storm that crippled the state. Yet thousands of Facebook users have shared posts implying that Biden has ignored the matter. “4 million freezing Texans without power…not one word from Joe!” one Feb. 17 post , shared more than 4,000 times, reads. Another post from the same day, shared by more than 3,000 users, similarly says: “4 million without power and not a peep from Joe. Anyone surprised?” We didn’t find direct, public remarks from Biden about the crisis in Texas prior to Feb. 17 — such as, say, on Twitter or during his Feb. 16 CNN town hall event . But the claims mislead by disregarding the fact that he approved the emergency declaration days earlier — and also held a Feb. 16 call with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and the governors from six other states, to discuss the extreme weather conditions. “President Biden relayed to the governors that he understood the severity of the conditions being felt across the states, and that he and the First Lady were praying for swift recovery from the effects of the storm,” a White House readout of his call says. “President Biden reiterated to all the governors that his Administration is prepared to assist and stands ready to respond to requests for Federal assistance from the governors and will deploy any additional Federal emergency resources available to assist the residents of their states in getting through this historic storm.” Also, Biden has made Twitter statements since the original publication of the posts, but Facebook users continue to share the misleading claims nonetheless. As for the emergency declaration, Abbott requested that designation on Feb. 13 and Biden approved the measure the next day, thereby allowing federal funds and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid in the response. By Feb. 16 — the day of Biden’s call with governors — the weather had taken its toll on Texas’ energy infrastructure and left more than 4 million without power. As of early Feb. 19, there were about 192,000 still without electricity in Texas, according to PowerOutage.US. It’s also worth noting that on Feb. 17, Vice President Kamala Harris began an interview with NBC’s “TODAY” show by remarking on the situation on behalf of her and Biden. “I just want to mention all of those folks in Texas and the mid-Atlantic,” Harris said. “I know they can’t see us right now, because they’re without electricity, but the president and I are thinking of them, and really hope that we can do everything that is possible, through the signing of the emergency orders, to get federal relief to support them.” On Feb. 18, Biden’s official presidential Twitter account tweeted : “Jill and I are keeping Texas, Oklahoma, and other impacted states in our prayers. I’ve declared states of emergency, authorized FEMA to provide generators and supplies, and am ready to fulfill additional requests. Please heed the instructions of local officials and stay safe.” The same day, he approved an emergency declaration for Oklahoma and Louisiana . And he had another call with Abbott.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Posts Twist Meaning of CDC, FDA Disclosure on Bivalent Booster\". [/INST] Most of the systems set up to detect early signs of potential problems with the COVID-19 vaccines haven’t given any indication that the bivalent booster from Pfizer/BioNTech may correspond with a certain type of stroke in those 65 and older. But one system did. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration issued an explainer on Jan. 13 reporting that the Vaccine Safety Datalink — a real-time monitoring system that the CDC has used since 1990 — had “met the statistical criteria to prompt additional investigation into whether there was a safety concern for ischemic stroke in people ages 65 and older who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent.” The CDC and FDA also explained: “Although the totality of the data currently suggests that it is very unlikely that the signal in VSD represents a true clinical risk, we believe it is important to share this information with the public,” the CDC and FDA wrote in the explainer. Despite all the context offered by the CDC and FDA and the fact that the similarly formulated COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna wasn’t flagged, anti-vaccine campaigners took the announcement and used it to wrongly suggest that the agencies had found a causal link between the booster and strokes. Dr. Simone Gold , who has frequently spread misinformation about COVID-19 treatments, wrote in a Twitter thread about the announcement: “We’ve know the truth for a while. We’ve warned the public about the potential dangers associated with experimental biological agents. The public health officials who marketed these vaccines as ‘completely safe’ while censoring dissenting voices have blood on their hands.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , who leads the anti-vaccination organization Children’s Health Defense, took a similar approach, referencing the accumulation of claims from anti-vaccination campaigners since the shots became available as though they were correct.  “Alarming new information from the CDC + FDA that everyone else has known for almost two years,” he wrote on Twitter . And conspiracy theorist Stew Peters took it even further, claiming on Rumble that the “CDC ADMITS Vaxx Causes Strokes.” But, as is clear from the explainer that publicly disclosed the potential problem, the CDC has not identified any kind of causal link. The extent of its finding is that data collected through the VSD indicated that researchers should investigate whether or not those who are 65 or older may be at risk of having an ischemic stroke in the first few weeks following a booster dose with the Pfizer bivalent vaccine. The system’s flag was based on comparing the risk for stroke in the 21 days following vaccination with days 22-42 following vaccination. An ischemic stroke happens when a vessel that brings blood to the brain is obstructed, usually by fatty deposits on vessel walls and blood clots , according to the American Stroke Association. This type of stroke accounts for more than 80% of all strokes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. The VSD found that out of about 550,000 people who were 65 or older, 130 had strokes within three weeks of getting the shot, according to reporting in the Washington Post . None of those who had a stroke died. “Often these safety systems detect signals that could be due to factors other than the vaccine itself,” the statement disclosing the potential issue said. Safety monitoring systems like VSD are designed to catch a wide array of potential signals so that researchers can assess whether health agencies should change their recommendations. We’ve written about examples similar to this one , where systems detected a potential issue and researchers found little or no evidence that the vaccines were causing the problem. We’ve also written about examples where safety monitoring systems detected a problem that researchers found was likely related to a vaccine, as in the case of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which can cause a particular kind of clotting that also involves low levels of blood platelets. The condition is very rare, and the CDC has recommended the two mRNA vaccines over J&J’s, which has accounted for only a small percentage of the vaccine doses administered in the U.S. As the Washington Post article noted, officials are skeptical that there’s a safety risk here because there’s no reason that this kind of problem would arise now, considering the large number of vaccines administered globally over the last two years, and there’s also no reason that it would be present in only the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and not in the similar one from Moderna. The fact that public health officials could detect a potential issue associated with the vaccines, though, shows that the system is working. But, in this case, it didn’t warrant a change in recommendations for the vaccines, which have been effective in preventing serious illness from COVID-19 and, studies have shown , can actually reduce the risk of stroke after infection with the virus that causes COVID-19."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Social Media Post Misrepresents Connecticut Ballot Question on Early Voting\". [/INST] Voters in Connecticut will have the option to establish early voting in the state by answering “yes” to a ballot question in this November’s election. Currently, Connecticut is one of four states that doesn’t offer early in-person voting, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other three are Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire. The proposed constitutional amendment to establish early voting received support from more than 30 civic and political organizations in Connecticut — including the AARP, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Connecticut Town Clerks Association. It passed with bipartisan support in both the state House and Senate . Now it’s being put to voters, who will be presented with a ballot question that asks: “Shall the Constitution of the State be amended to permit the General Assembly to provide for early voting?” But a post on social media makes the false claim that answering “yes” to the question would also “remove the requirement of a certified seal from certain ballots when submitted to the Secretary of the State (meaning that certain ballots don’t have to have security seals to be processed because we can trust them @ @ wink-wink-nudge-nudge saynomore).” That’s not true. The proposed amendment would — in addition to establishing early voting — amend the state’s constitution to remove a requirement that some copies of election results that are sent to the secretary of state be under seal. The state constitution currently says (emphasis ours): “At all elections for members of the general assembly the presiding officers in the several towns shall receive the votes of the electors, and count and declare them in open meeting. The presiding officers shall make and certify duplicate lists of the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each. One list shall be delivered within three days to the town clerk, and within ten days after such meeting, the other shall be delivered under seal to the secretary of the state .” The proposed measure would remove the words “under seal” from the sentence in bold. Desmond Conner, spokesman for Connecticut’s Office of the Secretary of the State, explained in an email to FactCheck.org that the elimination of the seal requirement is meant to update archaic language and would have no impact on ballot security. “In the late 1700s and early 1800s the town clerks delivered the election *results* [not ballots] … to the Secretary of the State after sealing them with hot wax,” he said. “That requirement is still in the constitution, and the amendment, in addition to allowing for early voting, would remove the hot wax seal requirement.” He also emphasized that “this has nothing to do with ballots, ballots are never and have never been done with a wax seal.” State law setting out requirements for how municipalities transmit election results to the secretary of state has changed over the years. In 1995, for example, it changed to allow transmission by fax and in 2003 it allowed transmission by “other electronic means,” according to the legislative history of Connecticut’s election law. Under the current system, Conner said, “town clerks mail the results to us after entering it into the election night reporting system.” Referring to the proposed amendment, Conner said, “this change in the constitution would remove the constitutional requirement that the results are given under seal (with a wax and seal), but as a practical matter nothing will change, they will still enter the results into the system and mail us a copy.” “To be clear,” he said, “ballots aren’t affected at all here; this has nothing to do with the ballots. Ballots are still returned by voters sealed twice – an inner envelope and an outer envelope.” So, the social media post misrepresents what the ballot measure would do. It would have no effect on ballot security. Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk misinformation shared on social media.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Viral Posts Lift Bogus ‘Quarantine’ Story from Satire Site\". [/INST] A spoof story has been circulating on social media, presented as though it’s real, spreading the false claim that unvaccinated Americans will be sent to “quarantine camps.” It’s completely made up. The story originated on a website called The Stonk Market , which includes a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that says, “TheStonkMarket.com is a financial satire site.” The original story was posted on June 17 with this headline: “President Joe Biden Announces Americans Not Vaccinated Before 2022 Will Be Put In Camps.” Less than a week later, two other sites had copied it. They both included a satire disclaimer at the bottom of the story. But social media users missed the note and left comments like this one on Facebook: “Oh he really wants a civil war…doesn’t he???!!!” Actor Noel Gugliemi, known for his role in “The Fast and the Furious” movies, shared a screenshot of the headline from one of the copycat sites with his 276,000 Instagram followers. He didn’t include a satire disclaimer at all and, instead, posted a comment that claimed, “Either put the poison in you or will try forcing the poison in you, either way you’ll get it or else.” The same screenshot was then featured in a TikTok video that’s been viewed more than 939,000 times. That video then migrated to another Instagram account, where it’s been viewed more than 38,000 times. Not only is the claim about “quarantine camps” completely fabricated, but Biden has said that he doesn’t think vaccines should be federally mandated. As we’ve explained before , as far back as Dec. 4 — before he had taken office and before the first vaccines were available — Biden was asked about potential vaccine mandates. He answered , “No, I don’t think it should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power, just like I don’t think masks have to be made mandatory nationwide, I’ll do everything in my power as president of [the] United States to encourage people to do the right thing.” His administration has maintained that posture since he took office. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki answered a question about the cruise industry and vaccine passports at a May 24 press conference by saying, “[W]e are not instituting vaccine passports from a federal level. We certainly understand that industries will make their own decisions about how to continue their — the work they need to do.” Then, at a July 12 press briefing , Psaki reaffirmed that the federal government wouldn’t mandate vaccinations, although she said the administration would support entities that do require the shots. “That’s not a decision that we are making. That’s not a — that is not our intention from the federal government,” Psaki said, responding to a question about local mandates. “There will be decisions made by private-sector entities, by universities, by educational institutions, and even perhaps by local leaders, should they decide that is how to keep their community safe. If they decide to make that decision, we certainly support them in that step.” The administration has encouraged people to get vaccinated, though, consistently highlighting the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. And Biden recently emphasized the importance of vaccination since the more easily transmissible delta variant of the virus that causes COVID-19 has become the dominant variant in the U.S. “[M]illions of Americans are still unvaccinated and unprotected,” Biden said on July 6. “And because of that, their communities are at risk. Their friends are at risk. The people they care about are at risk. This is an even bigger concern because of the delta variant.” He announced a shift in the focus of the vaccination program from large-scale facilities to, instead, “meet people where they are.” The administration is going to focus on supplying vaccines to local pharmacists and physicians and to invest in mobile vaccination clinics that can go to sporting events, places of worship, summer festivals — “wherever we can find people gathered,” Biden said. “Now we need to go to community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,” Biden said. The phrase about going “door to door” whipped up controversy among some conservative politicians and media personalities, who cast it as something akin to a mandate or forced vaccination scheme. For example, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, of Colorado, referred to the people knocking on doors as “ Needle Nazis, ” and Fox News host Tucker Carlson said , “I honestly think it’s the greatest scandal in my lifetime by far. … The idea that you would force people to take medicine they don’t want or need, is there a precedent for that in our lifetimes?” But, as we’ve explained , there’s no evidence to support the claim that the outreach effort would result in forced vaccinations. And, contrary to Carlson’s claim that vaccines aren’t needed, t he seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from COVID-19 has declined by more than 90% since the vaccines became available in the U.S. The seven-day average of daily deaths was 2,781 on Dec. 14; as of July 20, it was down to 237, according to the CDC . Psaki has made it clear that the federal government will not require anyone to be vaccinated against their wishes. “What we’re doing is local officials are going to areas where there are lower vaccination rates and providing information on where people can get access to a vaccine, where they can go, that it’s free,” Psaki told reporters on Air Force One on July 7. “It’s up to individuals to decide whether they want to get vaccinated or not.” The outreach effort relies on “trusted messengers” — who are largely doctors and community and faith leaders — going door to door in areas with low vaccination rates to answer questions and talk about the vaccines, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 response coordinator, explained at a July 8 press briefing. So, there is no evidence of a forced vaccination program or quarantine camps for the unvaccinated.

A conservative satire account called U.S. Ministry of Truth had posted the claim on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Feb. 16, saying, “ JUST IN: President Biden announces tax incentives for families willing to take in slav— migrants in a new ‘Housing for Labor’ initiative. ‘You can now apply to keep a migrant in your home in exchange for cooking, cleaning, picking crops, and landscaping.’ – via @IRSnews.” There is no such announcement on the IRS X account . Also, the photo featured in the U.S. Ministry of Truth’s post shows President Joe Biden signing legislation, but it has nothing to do with immigration. The picture , from the White House Flickr account, shows Biden on June 3 signing an agreement to raise the debt ceiling. Other fact – checking outlets have written about the claim, and the U.S. Ministry of Truth has mocked them for “fact-checking a satire account.” But the problem with content posted by self-described satire accounts is that such claims get copied and reposted by other accounts without the satire disclaimer, so social media users have no way of knowing the claim is supposed to be a joke. We’ve written about many other similar examples over the years . In this case, screenshots of the original X post are circulating on other platforms without any indication that the claim was intended to be satirical. For example, one California politician shared the meme with his 229,000 followers on Instagram , and he included this message: “Modern day slavery signed into law.” But, as we said, the claim is made up. “Modern day slavery” has not been codified in the U.S."

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Posts Share Fake Chelsea Clinton Quote About Global Childhood Vaccination Effort\". [/INST] On April 24, multiple organizations, including the World Health Organization and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, announced a joint project called the Big Catch-Up to increase the number of children who are up-to-date on their vaccines. The initiative is particularly focused on 20 countries that are home to especially large numbers of children who missed routine vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic. These nations are primarily in Africa and Asia, and do not include the U.S. Chelsea Clinton , vice chair of the Clinton Foundation, spoke briefly about the Big Catch-Up on April 25 at Fortune’s Brainstorm Health conference, emphasizing the importance of making sure people don’t die of preventable infectious diseases in the U.S. or abroad. Many social media posts are sharing an article that uses a fabricated quote in its headline: “Chelsea Clinton: ‘It’s Time To Force-Jab Every Unvaccinated Child in America.’” A spokesperson for Clinton told the Associated Press that Clinton did not say this. We were also unable to find a record of Clinton saying this. The article was published on the People’s Voice, which is the new home for content from News Punch — a website with a history of spreading falsehoods and undergoing name changes . The article does not specify when Clinton supposedly made remarks about “force-jabbing” children but references the Big Catch-Up, stating: “Chelsea – via the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) – along with the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation says she hopes to force jab unvaccinated children via a new initiative called ‘The Big Catch-up.’” However, the Big Catch-Up will not involve forced vaccinations, WHO spokesperson Daniel Epstein told us in an email. “There are no mandatory vaccinations associated with this effort. Some countries require vaccines for children to enroll in school,” he said. The press release announcing the project stated that missed vaccines during the pandemic have led to outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio and yellow fever. Children missed vaccines because health services were overburdened or closed, access to medical supplies was disrupted, and people’s travel was restricted, the release explained. “To ensure progress on childhood immunization, partners are working with countries to strengthen health care workforces, improve health service delivery, build trust and demand for vaccines within communities, and address gaps and obstacles to restoring immunization,” the release said. It added that further effort needs to go into vaccinating adolescents against human papillomavirus. And while the Big Catch-Up is a global effort, it will “have a particular focus on the 20 countries where three quarters of the children who missed vaccinations in 2021 live,” the press release said. The U.S. is not on this list. Clinton mentioned the need for American parents to get their children vaccinated as an aside during her Brainstorm Health conference remarks on the Big Catch-Up. But she did not say anything about forcing parents to get their children vaccinated. In a separate part of the same interview not focused on the Big Catch-Up, Clinton spoke about vaccine hesitancy. Again, there was no reference to forcing vaccines on children. “I spend a lot of time thinking about the really unfortunate, to try to use a not-too-judgmental word, rise in not only vaccine hesitancy and questioning, but outright rejection of vaccines and of science and the scientific process and also too often on our scientists, our epidemiologists, our frontline health care workers,” she said.

        "text": "[INST]Please evaluate the following claim \"Evidence Still Lacking to Support Ivermectin as Treatment for COVID-19\". [/INST] After more than 80 studies have evaluated the use of ivermectin , an antiparasitic medication, to treat or prevent COVID-19 in humans, the National Institutes of Health , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have determined there is insufficient evidence to recommend using ivermectin to treat COVID-19. As we’ve reported , large clinical trials to determine its safety and effectiveness are ongoing, and results are expected in about a month. But so far, randomized controlled trials have shown no evidence of a clinical benefit for ivermectin. And the medication has not been approved or authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19. Yet, some people keep touting the effectiveness of the medication against COVID-19. In February, we fact-checked a misleading claim about ivermectin and the NIH, as well as false claims that a Japanese company had found ivermectin had w orked in a phase 3 clinical trial, which was based on an inaccurate news article . On March 6, John Campbell, who has a doctorate in nursing education but is not a physician , posted a video about the drug that amassed nearly a million views. It incorrectly presented two weak studies as “powerful” and “overwhelming” evidence that the drug works to combat the disease. “Why isn’t this in the newspapers?” Campbell asks his viewers after reviewing preliminary results of a study that was later canceled by its authors and the results of a flawed study. “This is why I think ivermectin is going to be one of the big scandals of this [pandemic]. It’s almost as if information has been deliberately suppressed throughout the pandemic, to be quite honest.” On March 14, Campbell replaced the original video with a new version that eliminates the discussion of the first study. Information on the ongoing and completed studies on ivermectin has been widely available, and the public can access the information on the NIH website. The studies Campbell highlights are not in the news because both have significant limitations and are not randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold standard of clinical research. Such trials randomly assign participants to treatment or control groups, enabling researchers to more confidently evaluate whether a treatment led to different results."
